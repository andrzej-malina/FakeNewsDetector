Tags Aleppo Idlib Syria education children At least six children were killed and 15 injured in rebel rocket attacks in the government-held west of Aleppo city on Thursday just a day after deadly airstrikes on a school complex in Idlib left 35 people including 22 children dead. The rocket fire in Aleppo hit two neighbourhoods in the west of the city with one of the attacks striking a school. ""Three children were killed and 14 students were injured in a terrorist rocket attack on the national school in the Shahba neighbourhood of Aleppo"" state news agency SANA reported. It added that the attack also damaged the school. A second rocket attack hit a house in the Hamdaniyeh neighbourhood killing three brothers and injuring a fourth SANA said. The two neighbourhoods are in the west of the city which has been roughly divided since mid-2012 when rebels seized its eastern half. Syrian rebels regularly target west Aleppo with airstrikes with civilian deaths as a result of such strikes not uncommon. Recently on October 13 Syrian state media reported that four people had been killed in rebel shelling of a school in the Sulemaniyeh district of west Aleppo. Since late September Syrian regime forces backed by Russia have embarked on an intense aerial and ground campaign aimed at recapturing east Aleppo. Hundreds of people have been killed in attacks that have also targeted hospitals and water infrastructures in the area. According to Save the Children more than 4200 schools in Syria have been damaged destroyed militarised and used as detention centres or been converted into shelters for internally displaced in near six years of conflict. In September 2015 the humanitarian organisation reported that half of all attacks on schools worldwide between 2011 and 2015 had occurred in Syria. On Wednesday the UN childrens agency UNICEF said 22 children had been killed along with six teachers in airstrikes on a school in rebel-held Idlib province. The strikes carried out by either Russian or Syrian warplanes according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights hit the village of Hass. Moscow denied any involvement in the raids. The British-based Observatory which has a network of sources in Syria gave a toll of 36 dead among them 15 children and four teachers. The incident prompted outrage from UNICEF director Anthony Lake. ""This is a tragedy. It is an outrage. And if deliberate it is a war crime"" he said adding that the school complex had been hit repeatedly.

Douma is regularly targeted by government fire and in recent months regime forces have waged an offensive in the area which has also been under siege since 2013. More than 300000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests. Read Also"

The operation was carried out on Sunday night as the terrorists tried to infiltrate Jobar region in Eastern Ghouta. The Syrian army forces in cooperation with the popular forces surrounded the terrorists and attacked them in an ambush operation and killed 35 members of Jaish al-Islam and Filaq al-Rahman terrorist groups in a several-hour-long clashes. In a relevant development in Syria the army thwarted a series of attacks by the Takfiri terrorists on a strategic region in Aleppo province Northern Syria. The Takfiri terrorists were trying to attack a strategic region of Jamiat al-Zahra in Western Aleppo but they failed. Aleppo has been the scene of heavy clashes between the terrorists and the Syrian troops in the last several weeks. Also the Syrian army backed by popular defense forces seized back a strategic town in Hama province. The army units took control of al-Karima town before starting their advances towards Sahl al-Qab region in Western Hama. Al-Karima town is of strategic importance because it links the three provinces of Homs Idlib and Lattakia. The victory in Karima paves the way for the Syrian army to move towards Shal al-Qab region. Elsewhere the Syrian army and the Lebanese Hezbollah forces continued their advances in the Western parts of the town of al-Zobdani. Al-Zobdani is now the scene of fierce clashes between the Syrian and Lebanese forces and militants of Jeish al-Fath terrorist group.

Tags Syria Hama airstrikes civilian casualties Maardes Jund al-Aqsa Jaish al-Fatah At least 25 civilians have been killed by government airstrikes in Syrias central province of Hama as government forces responded to a major rebel offensive in the area. According to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights [SOHR] the deaths occurred during overnight raids on a road near the town of Latamina. Syrian state media claimed that government forces had killed 50 ""terrorists"" in ""concentrated strikes"" in the area. Hamas recent upsurge in violence follows the launch of a major offensive by the Western-backed Free Syrian Army and other rebel groups including Jaish al-Fatah and Jund al-Aqsa to push regime forces out of the central province. SOHR also reported more rebel gains were made in Hama where the rebels have seized control of 14 villages in four days. The gains are predominantly to the north of Hama province including the towns of Suran and Halfaya. ""They are about 10 kilometres from the [Hama] airport"" said SOHRs director Rami Abdel Rahman. Hama city was briefly in rebel hands at the start of Syrias revolution but was subject to a siege by the regime who later recaptured the city. The city was also the centre of an Islamist uprising in 1982 which was brutally supressed by the Syrian army with as many as 40000 people - mostly civilians - dying in the bombardment. Read Also"

It is led by Jawad Abu Hatab elected by the opposition-in-exile National Coalition. Daraa was the cradle of Syrias uprising in 2011 when demonstrators took to the streets to call for President Bashar al-Assads ouster.

The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Monday that at least 15 people were killed as the coalition carried out raids in a northern district of Manbij city. The UK-based group which advocates the Syrian opposition said six more people lost their lives in a village near Manbij after similar attacks by coalition fighter jets. The so-called multinational task force against ISIL started its controversial mission in Iraq in late 2014 after ISIL seized control over territories west and north of the country. The United States claims the attacks are carried out to assist Syrian Kurds and Arabs fighting against ISIL in areas along the Turkish border in the province of Aleppo. However the attacks have led to numerous deaths among the civilians and Syrian military forces. The US and allies use the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey to bomb purported ISIL positions in northern Syria and Iraq.

A regime helicopter struck twice a mourning location in the opposition-held Bab al-Nairab district in Aleppo Ibrahim Abu Leith told Anadolu Agency. ""Twenty people were killed and 30 others injured in the attack"" he said. According to Abu Leith women and children were among the fatalities. He said the second attack took place when the helicopter dropped another barrel bomb on people who rushed to the scene to help the victims of the first attack. The injured were rushed to field hospitals amid fears that death toll may rise as a number of civilians remain trapped under the debris of their destroyed homes. In recent weeks regime helicopters - along with Russian and Syrian warplanes - have struck a number of marketplaces hospitals and civil defense centers in opposition-held parts of war-battered Aleppo city. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Bashar al-Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests - which erupted as part of the ""Arab Spring"" uprisings - with unexpected ferocity. Since then more than a quarter of a million people have been killed and more than 10 million displaced across the war-battered country according to the UN. The Syrian Center for Policy Research however put the death toll from the six-year conflict at more than 470000 people."

""Straight after the coalitions strikes IS militants launched an offensive"" said the statement adding that ""fierce fighting against the terrorists"" ensued nearby. ""If these strikes were due to an error in the target coordinates that would be a direct consequence of the US refusal to coordinate with Russia its fight against the terrorist groups in Syria"" it said. While Russian jets deployed in Syria were not operating in the area at the time of the coalition strikes they later intervened ""in support of the Syrian army by targeting IS"" Russian General Vladimir Savchenko said. ""A total of 10 strikes were carried out"" starting from 1600 GMT he said in a television briefing."

__label__1	"__topic__2 At least 100 civilians dead in toxic gas attack in Syrias Idlib Published April 4 2017 The Assad regime has used chemical weapons once again killing at least 100 civilians including children in an airstrike that released on the opposition-held Idlib. Thirty ambulances were dispatched from Turkey to rescue those in dire need of help. The Assad regime continues to commit crimes against humanity as more than 100 civilians were killed and 500 others mostly children have been affected by the chlorine gas attack carried out by regime warplanes in the Khan Shaykun town in Idlib. The latest chemical attack was seen as the worst in the countys six-year war. With many civilians suffering respiratory problems in dire need of help Turkey dispatched 30 fully equipped ambulances for rescue operations. The reports claim that it was the third chemical attack in over a week in Syria as the Assad regime consistently targets residential areas. The first two attacks were reported in Hama province an area close to yesterdays chemical attack. After the gas attack the Syrian regime reportedly bombarded a hospital in the town where doctors were treating victims. Turkey condemned the chemical attack on Syrias opposition-held town of Idlib describing it as ""a crime against humanity."" The chemical attacks on Idlib were ""inhuman"" and ""unacceptable"" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said while stressing the importance of maintaining the fragile Syrian cease-fire. In a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin the president reiterated the need for further efforts to strengthen cooperation in the fight against terrorism. Foreign Minister Mevlt avuolu also stated that the suspected use of chemical weapons could derail the process of Syrian peace talks being held in Astana Kazakhstan. The parallel series of talks in Astana Kazakhstan aim to bolster the truce to support the U.N. negotiations. Damascus has been the scene of heavy fighting in recent days with the moderate Syrian opposition making large incursions into the east of the Syrian capital while the Assad regime has responded with airstrikes on opposition positions. The last round of Astana talks began on Feb. 23 and ended on March 4 without any clear result. The next meetings in Astana are to be held on May 3-4. The global chemical arms watchdog said it was ""seriously concerned"" by reports of a suspected gas attack. ""The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is seriously concerned about the alleged chemical weapons attack reported by the media this morning in the Khan Sheikhun area of southern Idlib"" the group said adding it was ""gathering and analyzing information from all available sources."" Chlorine gas is one of several elements and compounds used in devastating chemical attacks outlawed by international treaties. A high level of exposure to the gas can cause suffocation as the chemical injures the pulmonary airways resulting in severe fluid buildup in the lungs with children and seniors particularly vulnerable. In the wake of the 2013 attack Assad agreed to a Russia-sponsored deal to destroy his chemical arsenal and joined the Chemical Weapons Convention. His government declared a 1300-ton stockpile of chemical weapons and so-called precursor chemicals that can be used to make weapons amid international outrage at a nerve gas attack on the outskirts of Damascus. Those weapons have been destroyed but member states of the OPCW have repeatedly questioned whether Assad declared everything in 2013. The widely available chemical chlorine was not covered in the 2013 declaration and activists say they have documented dozens of cases of chlorine gas attacks since then. The Syrian government has consistently denied using chemical weapons and chlorine gas accusing the rebels of deploying it in the war instead. Frances foreign minister called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council after what he said was a ""disgusting"" gas attack on Syrias rebel-held Idlib province. ""In the face of such serious actions that threaten international security I ask for everyone not to shirk their responsibilities. With this in mind I ask for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council"" he added. France Britain and the United States in February put forward a resolution to impose sanctions targeting Syrian government officials over accusations of chemical weapon attacks during the six-year conflict. The international inquiry found Syrian regime was responsible for three chlorine gas attacks and that Daesh militants had used mustard gas."

Mostly Kurds live in the eastern suburbs of Damascus where the incident occurred Sino told journalists on Thursday. In order to estimate the number of victims a special international commission is indispensable to reveal all circumstances of the tragedy the Kurdish official said. There is no alternative to the peace process. Kurds always call for resolving the conflict by political means and for convening the Geneva conference as soon as possible Sino said.

Syrian army units and the supporting forces fully retook the al-Qaryatain city in Homs after the remaining gatherings of the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant were eliminated. Syrian army units and the supporting forces fully retook the al-Qaryatain city in Homs after the remaining gatherings of the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) takfiri group were eliminated a source on the ground announced on Sunday. Seizing control over the city which is located in southeastern Homs came after the army units in cooperation with allied forces earlier advanced further inside it from various directions removing all mines on their way and had established control over the northern neighborhood. The army units have hunted down fleeing ISIL terrorists inside the city and dismantled scores of explosive devices and mines left behind. Earlier today army units took control of al-Mazare and al-Kharroubi al-Kabir areas to the northwest of al-Qaraytain which are now completely secured after tens of explosive devices and mines were removed. In the morning the armys air force conducted airstrikes against positions and dens of ISIL terrorists in the southern and eastern sides of al-Qarayatin and in Marmalet al-Qaryatain leaving many terrorists dead and destroying their weapons and vehicles some of them equipped with heavy machineguns. In the eastern countryside of Homs province the air force conducted launched strikes against gatherings movements and supply routes of ISIL to the east and north of Palmyra city and to the north of al-Buseiri village inflicting losses upon the terrorists there. More hideouts and vehicles for ISIS terrorists were hit and destroyed in army airstrikes in the villages of al-Shindakhiyeh al-Shamaliyeh Mannoukh and Housis. In Hama army units in cooperation with the popular defense groups foiled an attack launched by al-Nusra Front terrorists against a number of military posts in the vicinity of al-Huweijeh village in the far northwest of Hama countryside and Qassr Abu Samra in the northeastern countryside. A military source reported that heavy clashes broke out between the defenders of the military posts and the attacking terrorist groups which resulted in the death of at least 50 terrorists. Three vehicles equipped with machine guns a tank and a rocket launcher were destroyed during the confrontation with the army units seizing the terrorists weapons and ammunition including a DShK machine gun a rocket shell launcher and amounts of RPG shells. In Sweida an army unit targeted a gathering of ISIS terrorists in Asheihib al-Janoubi Hill in the northeastern countryside of the southern Sweida province. A military source said the targets were directly hit with many terrorists getting killed or injured while their vehicles were destroyed or damaged. In Deir Ezzor the armys air force targeted assembly points of ISIL terrorists and their hideouts in al-Jafra village in the eastern countryside of the eastern Deir Ezzor province. A number of terrorists were killed and their vehicles and equipment were destroyed. In the meantime local sources said the popular resistance in the eastern area killed several ISIL terrorists during the past two days including Tunisians.

At least 19 people were killed overnight according to the Syrian Obervatorty for Human Rights due to heavy shelling and regime forces advance to entrances of Masaken Hanano. Clashes on Monday continued between regime forces and rebels backed by Fateh al-Sham around eastern Aleppo amid mutual bombardment from both sides. Aerial bombardments were focused on Ferdous and areas of Der Hafir according to Syrian activists. The situation has been dire for civilians as news confirmed that there were no more functioning hospitals in eastern Aleppo where more than 250000 people are currently living under siege and in need of urgent medical care according to the UN has said. United States President Barack Obama confessed the crisis could persist for quite some time. I am not optimistic about the short-term prospects in Syria Obama said at a news conference in Lima at the conclusion of a summit with leaders of Pacific Rim countries. UN agencies including WHO have been barred from entering eastern Aleppo since July when regime troops seized the last access route leaving the area cut off from food and medical aid for more than four months.

Russian jets bombed a medical center in the town of Khan Tuman in southern rural Aleppo earlier on Wednesday killing 15 members of medical staff activists in the town reported. The attack on the hospital comes two days after Russian jets hit a UN-Syrian Red Crescent aid convoy near the town of Urum Alkobra near Aleppo. The attack left 12 people killed including aid workers. The Syrian Coalition said that this barbaric attack on the hospital represents a continuation of the criminal acts perpetrated by Russia aimed to quell the Syrian revolution and force the Syrian people to agree to Russian dictations. The Coalition strongly condemned these crimes calling on the international community and the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) to assume its responsibilities towards the protection of civilians in Syria; the establishment mechanisms to enforce the truce; and holding violators of the truce to account. Russia and the Assad regime violated the truce no fewer than 264 times since it came into force last week. Over 65 people have been killed as a result of these violations. These crimes and violations have effectively ended the truce; undermined all chances of a political solution; and demonstrated insistence by the Assad regime and its allies on pursuing the policy of killing and destruction the Coalition added.

A car bomb has killed four people in the Sumaria area in the Syrian capital Damascus as citizens are bracing for a possible US attack the official Syrian news agency has reported. According to SANA the car bomb caused big flames and damaged surrounding buildings. Four people were killed and 6 were wounded in the attack which happened near the Research and Tests Center affiliated to the Syrian Ministry of Industry. Damascus residents already accustomed to incessant warfare within the Syrian capital were making final preparations this weekend for an attack from outside attempting to anticipate where American missiles might strike. Tensions rose higher in the region after US rushed to dispatch its warships toward Syria threatening to bomb several areas in the country based on conflicting reports of an alleged chemical attack in the country. The US-backed militants posted pictures and videos of an alleged chemical attack which they claimed the Syrian army was responsible for it. The Syrian government which has already called for UN action against several cases of chemical attacks by anti-Syria militants in the country rejected the claims as baseless and paved the way for visiting UN team of inspectors to investigate the story. Syria says the attack was actually carried out by the foreign-backed militants to open way for their Western and regional supporters to attack Syria. Despite killing of at least 100000 people in the massive insurgency in Syria the US had said that it would enter the conflict if a chemical attack was carried out.

The death toll from the shelling attacks launched by al-Nusra terrorists on neighborhoods in areas in Aleppo province in the past 24 hours has reached 20 people in addition to tens of others injured SANA reported.

__label__0	__topic__2 ISIS Continues to Displace Locals in Rural Deir Ezzor Friday 10 July 2015 19:14 ISIS Continues to Displace Locals in Rural Deir Ezzor. The Syrian Network for Human Rights said in a report released today that ISIS had forced at least 33000 residents out of their homes in the town of Abu Hamam in rural Deir Ezzor since 10 August 2014. According to report ISIS has executed around 367 people in the town while 240 more have gone missing. The Syrian Coalition has previously condemned the heinous crime committed by ISIS in eastern rural Deir Ezzor where residents discovered a mass grave containing 230 corpses of tribesmen who were summarily executed by ISIS in late 2014. The area was the scene of fierce battles between the Shaitat tribesmen and ISIS militants who eventually took control of the area and rounded up hundreds of tribesmen and executed them on charges of apostasy. The Syrian Coalition stresses that modern dictatorships have left nothing but a legacy of mass graves death and destruction. Four years have passed since Assad embarked on his brutal campaign on the Syrian people and now ISIS to pursue the same campaign and one can hardly find any difference between the two in terms of the scale of their criminality and barbarity.

__label__0	__topic__2 Syria rebels kill 7 in Aleppo assault capture 3 villages _ monitor | Jordan Times Last updated at Jun 182016 BEIRUT At least seven people died in rebel shelling of a neighbourhood of the Syrian city of Aleppo held by the Kurdish YPG militia at dawn on Saturday a monitoring group said as rebels took territory to the south. More than 40 people were also wounded in the attack on the Sheikh Maqsoud area the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a district next to the only way in and out of rebel-held parts of the northern city the Castello road. An escalation in air and artillery strikes in recent weeks around the road has made it virtually impassable putting hundreds of thousands of people in Aleppo under effective siege. Hundreds of people have been killed in Aleppo since peace talks broke off in April as Syrias President Bashar Assad seeks to regain control of what was Syrias largest pre-war city now split between rebel and government sectors. Rebels have said in the past their attacks on Sheikh Maqsoud were in response to YPG attempts to cut the Castello road. The YPG controls nearly all of Syrias northern frontier with Turkey and has been a close ally of the United States in the campaign against Daesh in Syria. Many rebels in western Syria do not trust the YPG because they say it cooperates with Damascus rather than fighting it an accusation the YPG has denied Heavy bombardment Sheikh Maqsoud has been under intense bombardment since mid-February which has killed more than 132 civilians and injured around 900 more the observatory said. A 48-hour ceasefire in Aleppo announced by Russia on Thursday has had little impact on fighting and air strikes and shelling have continued in and around the city since then. Three people two of them children died and more than nine people were injured by barrel bombs dropped from helicopters in the city the observatory said on Saturday. The White Helmets a group of civil defence emergency workers operating in rebel-held areas said on Twitter one of their buildings in Haritan in the north Aleppo countryside was hit by an air strike on Saturday. There were no injuries. The observatory also said on Saturday that rebels had captured three villages south of Aleppo from government control Zeitan Khalsa and Barna causing significant losses among government forces and their allies. The villages are near a main highway within rebel territory linking Aleppo with the capital Damascus to the south. They lie in an area captured by government forces at the end of last year in a large offensive assisted by Iranian-backed militias and Russian airpower. But the Syrian observatory said there has been a lack of Russian air support during this weeks battle for these villages. At least 86 members of Syrian government forces and its allies who include members of the Lebanese group Hizbollah and other Iranian-backed militias were killed in fighting in the south Aleppo area in the past four days the observatory said. The numbers could not be independently confirmed. The rebels are fighting alongside Al Qaeda-affiliated Al Nusra Front which like the Daesh terror group was excluded from a February ceasefire and from the Geneva peace talks.

__label__0	"__topic__2 Syrian regime bombs Kurdish fighters for second day Date of publication 19 August 2016 The uneasy peace in Syrias Hassakeh city was broken two days ago as clashes between regime and Kurdish forces escalated leading to Damascus to bomb separatist positions. Tags Qamishli Rojava Hassakeh Kurdish Syrian-Kurdish YPG Peoples Protection Units Turkey Syrian regime Syrian regime warplanes bombed Kurdish positions in the north-eastern city of Hassakeh on Friday as fighting between the two sides continued for a second day. The regime launched eight air raids - on the citys Kurdish-run south-western neighbourhoods - on Friday after an uneasy truce between regime and Kurdish militias broke down earlier this week leading to the latest bout of fighting. Images showed footage the city - reportedly Hassakeh - burning last night following one air raid. Control for Hassakeh city - the capital of the north-eastern province by the same name - is mostly in the hands of Kurdish forces while the rest is held by regime loyalists. Clashes between the two sides have rocked the city leaving 23 civilians - including nine children - dead according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Bombing and fighting has forced thousands of Hassakeh locals to flee in one of the most intense confrontations between the two sides in months. Thursdays air raids on Hassakeh were the first time the regime had bombarded Kurdish positions from the air. Damascus forces and Kurdish fighters have enjoyed a truce while the Islamic State group threatens the province and other Kurdish areas jointly controlled by the two sides. In Hassakeh and Qamishli tensions have led to armed clashes. Kurdish units have proclaimed independence of an autonomous region around the Turkish border and deeper into Syria and demanded that the pro-regime militias disband in Hassakeh. A regime source in Hassakeh told AFP that the bombing was ""a message to the Kurds that they should stop this sort of demand that constitutes an affront to national sovereignty"". Kurdish militias are key US allies in the fight against IS providing them with weapons and advisers on the battlefield. The US has also reportedly opened up an air base in Kurdish-controlled Syrian territory while Russia - which is helping prop up the regime - is also close to the Kurdish units.

Fresh strikes came as the Pentagon said that US-led coalition fighter jets scrambled to protect Kurdish forces working with American advisers in Syria as they were targeted by regime planes Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights - which monitors the conflict and determines which planes carry out raids according to their type location flight patterns and the munitions involved - said Fridays strikes were conducted by regime jets. The journalist in Hasakeh said eight air strikes could be heard throughout the day mostly focused in the citys southwestern neighbourhoods. Most of Hasakeh city the capital of the northeastern province by the same name is controlled by Kurdish forces while the rest is held by fighters loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. Since Wednesday clashes between the two forces have rocked the city leaving 23 civilians - including nine children - and 16 combattants dead the Observatory said. The Britain-based monitor said thousands of inhabitants had begun to flee Hasakeh where bread was running out and electricity supplies have been cut. Thursdays government raids on Hasakeh were the first time the regime had bombarded Kurdish positions from the air. The development prompted jets from the US-led coalition battling the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq to intervene in order to protect Kurdish forces working alongside US advisors a Pentagon spokesman said Friday. ""This was done as a measure to protect coalition forces"" Captain Jeff Davis said. ""We did make clear that US aircraft would defend troops on the ground if threatened."" The Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) are a key US ally in the fight against IS. Washington regards them as the most effective fighting force on the ground in Syria and has provided weapons and special forces military advisers. IS controls most of the Euphrates valley to the south of Hasakeh and tensions between regime and Kurdish forces have sometimes led to armed clashes in spite of their common jihadist enemy. The Kurds who control much of northeastern and northern Syria along the Turkish border where they have proclaimed an autonomous Kurdish region recently demanded that the pro-government National Defence Forces disband in Hasakeh. A government source in the city told AFP that the air strikes were ""a message to the Kurds that they should stop this sort of demand that constitutes an affront to national sovereignty"". More than 290000 people have been killed since Syrias conflict erupted in March 2011."

Tags Syria Idlib Russia airstrikes Syrian regime Bashar Assad Airstrikes on a rebel-held village in northwest Syria killed 12 people and put a nearby field clinic out of service early on Tuesday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said a first round of raids which were likely carried out by Russian jets targeted the village of Duwayleh in the Idlib province. ""Twelve people were killed including at least two rebel fighters and five civilians"" Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said. ""As they were bringing wounded people to the clinic in nearby Kafr Takharim new airstrikes hit near the facility"" Abdel Rahman told AFP. ""They put the hospital out of service because of damage to its structure and to the equipment"" he said. It was the second medical facility in rebel-held Idlib province to be targeted in four days after a warplane on Saturday severely damaged a makeshift hospital set up in a cave. That bombardment near the opposition-controlled village of Abdeen wounded five medical staff according to the Observatory. The World Health Organization has called Syria the worlds most dangerous place for health workers. The province of Idlib has been under the control of rebel and extremist groups since spring 2015 and is regularly bombarded by both Syrian and allied Russian warplanes. In early April at least 88 civilians were killed in a suspected chemical attack on Khan Sheikhun a town further south in Idlib province. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said last week that ""incontrovertible"" test results showed sarin gas or a similar substance had been used in Khan Sheikhun.

According to Syria Turks Association tanks artillery and missiles were used in the attack and explosions were also heard in villages located on the Turkish side of the border. Four wounded were brought to hospitals in Turkeys Hatay province for treatment. The attack is a larger part of the operation as Syrian army announced on Sunday that it had stepped up air strikes and retaken villages in a new offensive on opposition forces in coastal province of Latakia. Aerial bombardment had intensified over the past 48 hours in a bid to cut rebel supply lines in rugged territory close to Turkeys border an army source was quoted as saying on state media. Latakia province - home to Syrias biggest port and a stronghold of President Bashar al Assads Alawite sect - has been a key battleground of the conflict which is now in its fifth year. Sunni Muslim groups including al Qaedas Syrian offshoot the Nusra Front control many villages in the borderlands north of the government-held Mediterranean port city of Latakia and other areas dominated by Alawites who follow an offshoot of Shiite Islam. The army said five villages and hilltops including Beit Khadour Beit Zaifa Tel alKhadar and Jabal al Rahmaliya had been wrested back from the insurgents bringing it closer to the border areas. The army had stepped up its campaign in the province since insurgents took the strategically located town of Jisr al Shughour in April strengthening their position in a mountain range that overlooks Alawite villages and close to Qardaha hometown of the Assad family. The area has been in control of opposition forces since September 2012. The rough terrain and heavy forests has allowed the opposition forces to resist heavy Syrian army shelling and withstand heavy aerial bombing defense analysts say. A Syrian army officer said the aim of the latest operation was to cut rebel supply lines from the Turkish border to the rebel held villages including the town of Salma that has been held by Nusra Front since 2012. ""These armed men are weaker than to try to dare get close to Latakia"" a senior army officer was quoted as saying in a report from the area by Lebanese Hezbollahs television al-Manars correspondent. Last year the Syrian army wrested back control of the Christian town border town of Kasab a gateway to Turkey nearer the coast in Latakia after less than three months of control by opposition forces including Nusra Front. The Syrian war has taken on a starkly sectarian character with the overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim rebels backed by Sunni Gulf Arab powers fighting to overthrow Assad who is backed by Shiite Iran."

__label__0	__topic__2 MSF Syrian Regime Used Chemical Weapons in Hama Posted on April 2 2017 by Youssef Diab MSF Syrian Regime Used Chemical Weapons in Hama Beirut Doctors Without Borders (MSF) accused the Syrian regime and its allies of using chemical weapons in their bombardment of the Hama governorate on March 25. MSF reported that the regime targeted Latamneh hospital in the northern Hama governorate killing two people and causing severe respiratory symptoms among patients and staff. The hospitals orthopedic surgeon Dr. Darwish was one of two people killed. Thirteen people were transferred to other facilities for treatment. It reported that at around 600 pm on March 25 the Latamneh hospital was targeted by a bomb dropped by a helicopter which hit the entrance of the building. The organization relied in its report on information from the hospital staff that proved that chemical weapons were used. Patients and staff reported suffering severe respiratory symptoms and burning of mucous membranessymptoms consistent with an attack using chemicals. The hospital went out of service for three days due to the attack after which the emergency room reopened. The hospital is located a few miles from the frontlines and provides medical care for around 8000 people. Prior to the attacks the hospital had an emergency room and inpatient department and provided general and orthopedic surgery. Massimiliano Rebaudengo MSFs head of mission in northern Syria said that the loss of Dr. Darwish leaves just two orthopedic surgeons for a population of around 120000. Bombing hospitals although banned by International Humanitarian Law remains a common practice in Syria and health services are severely affected by these repeated attacks he added. Over the past year MSF has received reports of at least 71 attacks on 32 different health facilities which it runs or supports in Syria. On February 22 an MSF-supported health facility in Idlib governorate was hit by rockets killing six and wounding 33 others. Meanwhile Al-Nasr Army announced that the Hama battle will continue and the retreat of rebels from several locations does not mean they have been defeated. Battles continued between the regime forces and opposition factions on all fronts in Hama coinciding with dozens of air raids by Russian and Syrian war planes. Al-Nasr Army military spokesperson Lieutenant Iyad al-Homsi said The criminal gangs resorted to chemical weapons when they were no longer able to defeat us in the battlefield. Speaking to Asharq Al-Awsat he added Those who witness the number of deaths of regime forces and its affiliated militias will realize that victory is ours. We have proven to the world that after six years of killing destruction and displacement that our revolution will continue. Head of the Hama Media center Abu Yazan al-Noiami said that the retreat of rebel forces and the consequent advances of the regime over the past two days were caused by the regimes use of chemical gases. He added that both the regime and Iranian forces are resorting to media blackouts to hide the very high figures of their losses. He stressed Hundreds of Iranian militants were killed and over 30 tanks personnel vehicles and cannons were destroyed in this battle. In a new development 17 armed factions in coastal regions Aleppo Hama and Idlib announced that they agreed to form a comprehensive military operations room aimed at fighting the Syrian regime and restoring stability in the region. Opposition website al-Durrar al-Shamiyyah reported an informed source as saying that factions of al-Jabha al-Shamiyyah al-Sham Legion Mujahideen Army al-Nasr Army Idlib Army Freedom Brigade the Middle Company and many others are part of this operations room. According to the source Colonel Fadlullah Naji of the al-Sham Legion will head the room adding that during the last month and a half the troops had been meeting to agree on all details which he did not disclose. He said that the final meeting will be held in the coming few days to present the framework of the room after which it will be officially announced. Youssef Diab Launched in London

Date of publication 7 April 2017 A salvo of US cruise missiles have severely damaged a Syrian regime airbase that was used as a launchpad for a devastating chemical attack on an opposition village in Idlib. Tags Shayrat cruise missiles US Homs Idlib Khan Sheikhun Fifty nine US cruise missiles struck a Syrian regime airbase in Homs province early Friday morning which appears to have caused severe damage to the infamous military site. Shayrat Airfield was allegedly the launch pad for a devastating chemical attack on an Idlib village that left up to a hundred civilians dead including scores of women and children. A potent symbol of regime oppression the airfield has been used for countless air raids on civilian targets and the second largest airbase in Syria. It now appears to be inoperable after sustaining severe damage from the Tomahawk cruise missiles launched by two US destroyers. ""All aircraft located there have been damaged you can say it is completely destroyed"" regime TV reported while state news agency SANA said that six people were killed in the attack. Pro-regime media have reported that 15 regime fighter planes were destroyed and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Sukhoi-22s Sukhoi-24s and MiG-23s were based there. [click to enlarge] Russia was given prior warning by the US which likely prevented the killing of large numbers of air and ground crew but it appears some were caught by the missiles. Dozens of regime personnel were reported killed or injured in the attack with damage to air defences housing for officers and a fuel depot according to the observatory. Although it appears the airfield will no longer be used for more bombings by regime planes the regime still has many options while Russia still maintains the huge Hmeimem airbase in Latakia. The brief lull in regime bombing should still provide some relief for the civilians of Idlib. Read Also"

The IS bombers targeted two YPG and asayesh positions including a training camp in Hasakeh capital of the Kurdish-majority province of the same name. Control of the town is split between Kurdish forces and those loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Mondays twin bombings came as IS fighters press their assault on the embattled Kurdish town of Kobane on the border with Turkey. The jihadists have been trying since September 16 to conquer the town which would complete their control over a lengthy stretch of Syrias border with Turkey."

__label__1	__topic__2 Massive Daesh bomb attack kills 44 in Syrian Kurdish city | Jordan Times Last updated at Jul 282016 A massive bomb blast claimed by the Daesh terror group killed at least 44 people and wounded dozens on Wednesday in the Kurdish-majority Syrian city of Qamishli. It was the largest and deadliest attack to hit the city since the beginning of Syrias conflict in March 2011. Syrian state media gave a toll of 44 dead and 140 injured in the bombing which hit a western district of the city where several local Kurdish ministries are located. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor gave a toll of 48 dead adding that children and women were among those killed. Kurdish officials said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber driving an explosives-laden truck adding that the blast detonated a nearby fuel container. An AFP journalist saw devastating scenes in the bombs aftermath with distraught civilians some covered in blood staggering through rubble past twisted metal and the burned-out remains of cars. One man running along the streets was completely covered in blood his shirt drenched red. He was gripping the arm of a small boy whose face was grey and red with blood and dust. They ran past a hysterical woman who was crying and screaming her clothes torn. A girl and boy stood next to her apparently in shock. Children could be heard screaming as smoke rose from small fires that continued to burn amongst the rubble. Civilians and local security forces with guns slung across their backs worked to carry the dead and wounded from the remains of damaged and destroyed buildings. US probes civilian casualties Daesh claimed the attack in a statement circulated on social media calling it a response to the crimes committed by the crusader coalition aircraft in the town of Manbij a bastion of the extremist group in Syrias Aleppo province. Kurdish fighters have been a key force battling the extremists in north and northeastern Syria and are the main component in the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance currently seeking to oust Daesh from Manbij. They are backed by air strikes launched by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh in Syria and Iraq. A spokesman for the coalition said on Wednesday it had opened a formal investigation to determine whether its strikes near Manbij last week had killed civilians. The observatory reported that 56 civilians were killed in strikes as they fled a village near Manbij on July 19 and Colonel Chris Garver said there was sufficient credible evidence of civilian victims to warrant a probe. Qamishli is under the shared control of the Syrian regime and Kurdish authorities who have declared zones of autonomous administration across parts of north and northeast Syria. It has regularly been targeted in bomb attacks many of which have been claimed by Daesh. But a source in the Kurdish Asayesh security forces told AFP that this is the largest explosion the city has ever seen. The area that was targeted houses several Kurdish administration buildings including the defence ministry and was considered a secure zone with multiple checkpoints and security measures in place. This blast is the biggest in Qamishli in terms of both the toll and the damage since the beginning of the war observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. Local officials said hospitals in the city had been swamped with casualties from the attack. And Syrian state television carried an appeal from the governor of Hasakeh province where Qamishli is located urging residents to go to public and private hospitals to donate blood for the victims of the terrorist bombings. More than 280000 people have been killed in Syria since the war began with anti-government protests that were met with a regime crackdown. In Aleppo city at least 18 people were killed in government air strikes and artillery fire on Wednesday on rebel-held neighbourhoods in the east of the city the observatory said. The Syrian army meanwhile officially announced it had severed all the supply routes and crossings used by terrorists to bring mercenaries weapons and ammunition into eastern neighbourhoods of Aleppo. The opposition-held east has been effectively under siege since July 7 when government forces advanced within firing range of the sole remaining route in. Aleppo was once the countrys economic powerhouse but it has been ravaged by war and divided roughly between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012.

The deaths were the result of the latest bout in an escalating cycle of tit-for-tat attacks between regime forces and the opposition fighters holding the enclave on the Syrian capitals eastern outskirts. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a total of 43 civilians have been killed in the process most of them in Eastern Ghouta which has been besieged since 2013 and where humanitarian conditions are dire. Seven people including five children were killed in regime shelling and air strikes in Douma the main town in the Eastern Ghouta area Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. Elsewhere in Eastern Ghouta another child was killed in Harasta he said adding that two members of the White Helmets rescue organization were also among Fridays victims. On Tuesday the Ahrar al-Sham group which has positions in Harasta launched an attack on a regime military base in the area which is supposed to be a so-called ""de-escalation zone"" as part of a deal agreed between Russia Iran and Turkey to bring violence levels down. The fighting on that front has left at least 37 dead on the regime side according to the Observatory a toll the regime has not confirmed. Abdel Rahman said ""dozens"" of Islamist rebels were also killed. In retaliation for the latest deadly Ghouta shelling rebels fired rockets on Damascus killing three civilians Friday the same source said. Six had been killed the previous day including Syrias national karate coach Fadel Fadi who died of his wounds after being struck by shrapnel as he left his Damascus sports club the state-run Sana agency said. More than 330000 people are estimated to have been killed in the Syrian war that began in 2011 as anti-regime protests and millions have been displaced."

A hospital supported by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in the town of Maaret al-Nouman in rural Idlib was hit earlier today by Russian air airstrikes. At least seven people were killed and many more wounded in the deliberate attack on the hospital. The hospital was completely destroyed and the fate of at least eight members of staff is still unknown. The Syrian Coalition condemned the attack saying it is not the first hospital to be targeted by Russian warplanes. Russia has targeted civilian neighborhoods medical centers schools and houses of worship. This crime will not be the last as long as the international community keeps silent and shirks its responsibility to respond to them. While we hold Moscow fully responsible for these crimes we warn that the international communitys continued inaction serves as an incentive for Russia to commit more crimes in Syria. Russias acts in Syria will not only negatively affect the political process but will also encourage the spread of terrorism the Syrian Coalition stressed. The Syrian Coalition called upon the ceasefire task force formed as part of the Munich agreement not to ignore the horrible crimes Russia continues to commit against the Syrian people. These crimes would undermine all chances of reaching a political settlement to the conflict. The continued silence over Russias behavior in Syria undoubtedly represents complicity in these crimes and would ruin what has been achieved in Munich the Coalition said. These ongoing crimes especially after the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 2254 and the signing off on the Munich agreement undermine all chances of restoring trust in the international community. They cast doubt about the international communitys ability to find a real political solution to end the tragedy unfolding in Syria the Coalition added. (Source: Syrian Coalition) Twitter
__label__1	__topic__2 26 People Killed in Russian & Assad Regime Airstrikes on Schools & Public Market in Rural Idlib Wednesday 26 October 2016 26 People Killed in Russian & Assad Regime Airstrikes on Schools & Public Market in Rural Idlib. Airstrikes by the Assad regime and Russia air forces earlier on Wednesday hit a schools complex and a public market in the town of Hass in rural Idlib killing at least 26 civilians and wounding dozens more mostly schoolchildren and teachers. High-explosive parachute-retarded bombs were used in the airstrikes launched in a joint attack by the Assad regime and Russian air forces. The Syrian Coalition condemned this heinous crime against schoolchildren and civilians. In a statement released following the attack the Coalition stressed that the deliberate targeting of civilians using high-explosive weapons is clearly aimed at killing as many people as possible; causing mayhem; forcing civilians to leave their homes; and forcing them to agree to local truces out of the framework of the political process. Responsibility for this heinous crime lies with the international community as world leaders and active members of the United Nations continue to ignore these war crimes thus risk further fueling the conflict and undermining all chances of a political solution the Coalition added. The Coalition earlier said that the United Nations continues to ignore Russias crimes and its violations of international law urging it to make a thorough and real reconsideration of its positions and performance on Syria after the election of a new secretary-general.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the fate of around 200 other soldiers remained unknown as the IS assault forced the army to pull back late on Friday. The Division 17 base has fallen from army control but ""the jihadists have not moved into the site for fear of air strikes"" said the Britain-based groups director Rami Abdel Rahman. The IS lost at least 28 jihadist fighters he said. The Observatory said more than 50 troops were summarily executed 19 more were killed in a double suicide attack and at least 16 others had died in the IS assault launched early Thursday. ""Hundreds of troops surviving withdrew on Friday to safe places - either to nearby villages whose residents oppose IS or to nearby Brigade 93 - but the fate of some 200 remains unknown"" said Abdel Rahman. ""Some of the executed troops were beheaded and their bodies and severed heads put on display in Raqa city"" stronghold of the feared IS he said. The assault on Division 17 comes less than two weeks after IS killed 270 security guards employees and members of the paramilitary National Defence Forces during a jihadist assault on a gas field in Homs central Syria. On Friday the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria said IS fighters accused of atrocities are expected to be added to a UN list of possible war crime indictees."

Six civilians including a child were among at least 22 people killed in US air strikes on the stronghold of the Takfiri group ISIL (so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) on Saturday and Sunday a monitor said. The rest of the dead in the raids on the city of Raqa were ISIL militants the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Dozens of people were also wounded in the raids which took place on Saturday and Sunday. The US-led coalition which launched an air war against ISIL in Syria last September said it had carried out ""significant"" air strikes against Raqa. ""The significant air strikes tonight were executed to deny Daesh (ISIL) the ability to move military capabilities throughout Syria and into Iraq"" spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Gilleran said. ""This was one of the largest deliberate engagements we have conducted to date in Syria and it will have debilitating effects on Daeshs ability to move from Raqa."" Coalition forces ""successfully engaged multiple targets"" throughout Raqa the statement said destroying IS structures and transit routes. The strikes ""have severely constricted terrorist freedom of movement"" it added. Washington is leading an international coalition fighting ISIL in Syria and Iraq where the extremist group has proclaimed an Islamic ""caliphate"" in territory under its control. However many reports make doubts about the real intentions of the US raids pointing out that the coalition warplanes had dropped weapons and several supplies to the Takfiri insurgents. Leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei had repeatedly accused the US of backing the Takfiris saying that Washington is not honest in fighting ISIL. "

__label__0	__topic__2 Bus Bombing Marks End to Tragic Evacuation Deal in Syria April 18 2017 Bus Bombing Marks End to Tragic Evacuation Deal in Syria. For two Syrian mothers on opposite sides of a two-year siege their evacuation from the blockade was supposed to end their suffering but that was not the case in wake of a bombing outside the city of Aleppo. Noha a Shiite and Samira a Sunni were besieged for nearly two years on each side of Syrias civil war. At the weekend they finally escaped the suffocating blockades under an evacuation agreement but their ordeal was not over. As they waited at two transit points miles apart outside Aleppo a bomb attack hit Nohas bus convoy killing more than 120 people including dozens of children. After ambulances rushed off the wounded new buses arrived and the two convoys eventually reached their destinations one in regime territory and the other in rebel territory. In the hours leading up to Saturdays attacks the two women spoke to Reuters about what they had left behind their families being split up and the likelihood they would never return home. Reuters was not allowed back past security to try to find Noha after the blast and lost contact with Samira after speaking to her earlier on another evacuees phone. Weve lost everything. We hope to go back one day but I dont expect we wil said Noha 45 asking not to be identified by her last name. Noha left al-Foua one of two Shiite villages besieged by Syrian insurgents in Idlib province with her two youngest children and 5000 other people under a deal between the Syrian regime and armed opposition. In exchange 2000 Sunni residents and rebel fighters from the regime-besieged town of Madaya near Damascus Samiras hometown were given safe passage out and bussed to Idlib province a rebel stronghold via Aleppo. Thousands of Syrians have been evacuated from besieged areas in recent months under deals between Bashar al-Assads regime and rebels fighting for six years to unseat him. Rebels say it amounts to forced displacement of Assads opponents from Syrias main urban centers in the west of the country and engenders demographic change because most of the opposition and Syrias population are Sunni. There was little choice. We had to leave we were scared said Samira 55 who was traveling with her five adult sons. She had feared her sons would be arrested or forced to join the Syrian regime forces and fight once troops and officials of the Damascus regime moved into the town. Like Noha Samira was relieved to have escaped a crushing siege which had caused widespread hunger and in the case of Madaya starvation but had left everything behind including family. We owned three houses farmland and three shops in Madaya town. Now we dont have a single Syrian pound she said. Her daughter pregnant with a third child had stayed in Madaya because her husband had vowed to live and die there she said. Samira has not heard from her own husband for nearly four years after he was arrested by the regime. With nothing left and no place to stay in Idlib other than camps Samira said she would try to migrate joining the 5 million Syrian refugees who have left since the war broke out in 2011. More than 6 million are internally displaced. I dont want to be in Idlib we know no one there. Also you dont know when or where the jets might bomb she said referring to the heavy bombardment by Russian and Syrian warplanes of rebel-held areas in Idlib including a recent alleged poison gas attack. The plan is to try to get to Turkey to leave Syria for good. Noha was also heading into the unknown. I dont know where well live whether they (authorities) have anything set up. At the very least we just want to be safe. The children jump at night from the sound of rockets. We just want security wherever they take us she said. Her adult son and daughter had stayed in al-Foua but were hoping to leave in the next stage of the evacuation deal. Nohas husband had been killed but she did not say how. Both women said they would never have left their hometowns but for the strangling sieges which caused severe food and medicine shortages and the gradual change of control in each area. On Saturday a deadly explosion killed at least 100 including children regime supporters and opposition fighters at an evacuation point adding new urgency to the widely criticized operation. The blast ripped through a bus depot in the al-Rashideen area where thousands of regime loyalists evacuated the day before waited restlessly for hours as opposition fighters guarded the area while negotiators bickered over the completion of the transfer deal. Only meters away hundreds of evacuees from pro-rebels areas also loitered in a walled-off parking lot guarded by regime troops.

Activists said regime forces bombed the town of Saraqib in rural Idlib with chlorine-filled barrel bombs on Monday causing over 30 cases of asphyxiation among civilians. The attacks were carried out in a blatant violation of UN Security Council resolutions 2118 and 2235 banning the use of chemical weapons and toxic substances. In a press release issued earlier on Tuesday the Syrian Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to shoulder its responsibilities towards stopping such attacks. It stressed that urgent measures must be taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to protect the Syrian people. Any further delay in taking firm stance towards such attacks will open the door to more crimes and violations by the Assad regime the Coalition said. Separately over 12 civilians were killed and dozens injured including women and children when Russian jets raided the village of Abu Alduhour in rural Idlib on Monday. Five civilians were also killed in similar attacks on the village of Tal Toughan in rural Idlib. Activists said that the bombings were carried out by Russian forces in revenge for the death of five crewmen killed when their helicopter crashed near the town of Saraqib on Monday. The Syrian Coalition emphasized the need for the international community to assume its responsibilities regarding the protection of civilians in accordance with International Law (IL) and International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to stop war crimes and eliminate the constant threat of the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime.

Coalition war planes carried out 10 air strikes to try to repel the assault the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. It said at least 45 Islamic State militants and 20 Kurdish militia fighters had been killed. ISIS militants launched an assault on a Kurdish-controlled town on Syrias border with Turkey on Saturday prompting air strikes by the U.S.-led coalition to try to drive them back. The hardline Sunni fighters attacked Tel Abyad which is controlled by the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and the nearby town of Suluk in the early hours of Saturday YPG spokesman Redur Xelil and Turkish security sources told Reuters. Coalition war planes carried out 10 air strikes to try to repel the assault the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. It said at least 45 Islamic State militants and 20 Kurdish militia fighters had been killed. The attack was launched hours after a cessation of hostilities came into effect under a U.S.-Russian plan although the temporary truce does not apply to ISIS and Al-Qaeda affiliate the Nusra Front meaning the Syrian government Moscow and the coalition reserve the right to strike them. The truce appeared largely to be holding across much of Syria. Xelil said the YPG and Syrian Kurdish internal security forces were able to crush this attack and encircle the attackers although he gave no casualty toll. The YPG captured Tel Abyad from ISIS last year in an offensive backed by U.S.-led air strikes. The town lies north of Raqqa and had been a key supply line for the militant capital. The Turkish security sources said the attack was launched on two fronts and that the sound of gunfire and explosions audible from the town of Akcakale on the Turkish side had continued for several hours. Intermittent gunfire could still be heard. The security sources and a witness in Akcakale said war planes thought to be from the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS struck the militant positions and that the Turkish army had increased patrols on its side of the border. While not directly addressing the Tel Abyad attack 14 Turkish F-16s patrolled the Turkish-Syrian border on Friday Turkish military said. Xelil said some of the attackers infiltrated from the Turkish border to the north reiterating accusations that Turkey was supporting the group. Turkey has consistently denied those accusations and the security sources said recent measures to stop illegal crossings meant it was impossible that the attackers had entered from Turkey. Other attackers infiltrated from the south Xelil said. He said dozens of Islamic State fighters had been killed.

A man breathes through an oxygen mask at Al-Quds hospital. A hospital and a civil defence group said a gas what they believed to be chlorine was dropped alongside barrel bombs on a neighbourhood of Aleppo. (TRT World and Agencies) At least four people died and many suffered breathing difficulties when gas believed to be chlorine was dropped alongside barrel bombs on a neighbourhood of the Syrian city of Aleppo on Wednesday a hospital and a civil defence group said. Hamza Khatib the manager of Al-Quds hospital in Aleppo told a Reuters photographer the hospital had recorded four deaths from gas poisoning and 55 injuries. Seven people were still receiving hospital treatment. Khatib said he was preserving pieces of patients clothing and fragments from the barrel bombs as evidence for analysis. Syria Civil Defence a Syrian rescue service operating in rebel-held territory said it had recorded three deaths and 22 injuries after a barrel containing a gas suspected of being chlorine fell on the Zubdiya neighbourhood of rebel-held Aleppo. Civilians brought to the Al-Quds hospital after the suspected gas attack. (Reuters) The group which describes itself as a neutral band of search and rescue volunteers said it could not independently verify the nature of the gas. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a war monitor said helicopters dropped explosive barrels on the neighbourhoods of Seif al Dawla and Zubdiya leading to the death of a woman and her child from suffocation. The northern city of Aleppo Syrias most populous before the war is split into rebel- and regime-held districts. Capturing the whole city would be a major prize for Syrias Bashar al-Assad in the countrys five-year-old conflict. A fierce battle for control of the city broke out on Friday when rebels staged a major assault to break through a month-long regime siege of the citys rebel-held east where about 300000 people are thought to be living. Fighters managed to pierce the ring of regime-controlled territory but a safe corridor for civilians and aid has not yet been established. There have been unconfirmed reports among activists and residents of chlorine gas falling on rebel-held east Aleppo since the rebel offensive. The Aleppo Media Centre an online opposition news portal for the city posted a video that it said was of victims of the gas attack a child and adults wearing breathing apparatus. Two men interviewed said barrel bombs were dropped and there was a strong smell of gas. People then began to suffer breathing and eye problems. A boy breathes through an oxygen mask at Al-Quds hospital after the suspected gas attack. (Reuters) Western powers say the Syrian regime has been responsible for chlorine and other chemical attacks. The government has accused rebels of using poison gas. UN investigators established that sarin gas was used in Eastern Ghouta in 2013. The United States accused Damascus of that attack which it estimates killed 1429 people including at least 426 children. Damascus denied responsibility and blamed rebels. Later that year the United Nations and the Syrian regime agreed to destroy the states declared stockpile of chemical weapons a process completed in January 2016. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed in late 2015 that sulphur mustard commonly known as mustard gas had been used for the first time in the conflict without saying which party in the many-sided conflict it thought had used it.

__label__1	__topic__2 Syrian Coalition Condemns Horrific Massacre by Russian Air Force in Town of Atareb Aleppo Province Tuesday 14 November 2017 Syrian Coalition Condemns Horrific Massacre by Russian Air Force in Town of Atareb Aleppo Province. The Syrian Coalition strongly condemns the brutal crime which was committed by aircraft of the Russian occupation forces in the town of Atareb in western rural Aleppo on Monday November 13. Initial reports indicated that over 40 civilians were killed and hundreds more were injured when Russian jets fired vacuum missiles on a popular market in the town. Russia which has used every possible means to undermine the will of the Syrian people and impose devious schemes and projects on them continues to wriggle out of its commitments and obligations towards the de-escalation zones agreement. Instead of honoring its role as a so-called guarantor of the agreement Russia bombed a popular market that was full of civilians in the town of Atareb in broad daylight destroying dozens of houses and buildings though no rebel groups were stationed in the town which is under the authority of a civilian council and a local police force. Instead of changing its positions and exerting pressure on the Assad regime to force it to seriously participate in the Geneva process and abide by UN Security Council resolutions and engage in direct and serious negotiations this crime one again demonstrated that Russia is unwilling to change its stance. The crime has also proved that Russia is determined to side with the Assad regime; continue with the war crimes Against the Syrian people; and that it is not interested in stopping its crime nor forcing its allies to stop the crimes they are committing against the Syrian people. The Syrian Coalition holds Russia directly and fully responsible for the war crimes it has committed in Syria since the beginning of its direct military intervention in Syria as well as for the crimes of genocide and the Assad regimes use of chemical weapons and other internationally prohibited weapons. The Coalition calls on the UN Security Council to condemn this massacre and its perpetrators as well as to prosecute them by all possible means as war criminals and to take serious action to protect Syrian civilians from these continued massacres.

The group also reported eight civilians including two children were killed on Thursday in rebel fire on the government-held west of the city. An AFP journalist in Bab al-Nayrab saw rescue workers and civilians digging through the rubble of collapsed buildings. One man carried out the lifeless body of a baby no bigger than his forearm. The babys eyes were closed and its body was white with dust except for speckles and smears of blood. Elsewhere a civil defence worker protected the face of another dead child as his colleagues scraped away the rubble encasing the rest of the childs body. Syrias regime has been accused of regularly using barrel bombs crude explosive devices on rebel-held areas that are home to civilians and other parties to the conflict are not known to have used the weapons.

__label__1	__topic__2 Thirty Killed in Syrian Strikes on Damascan Suburb Town Posted on July 2 2016 by Asharq Al-Awsat English Thirty Killed in Syrian Strikes on Damascan Suburb Town Thirty civilians were killed on Saturday in intensive Syrian air strikes on a Damascan suburb town northeast of the city a day after the reported execution of a Syrian air force pilot a monitor and rebels said. The raids targeted a medical center a school and a residential area in Jayrud town rebels said. Jayrud is a heavily populated area that struck a local truce with the army that had saved it from the heavy bombing on other rebel held areas. It had made it a sanctuary for thousands of civilians fleeing heavy battles nearby. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said scores were also injured in the aerial strikes as well as shelling from army posts in the area. A rebel spokesman said the strikes seemed to be in retaliation for the killing of a Syrian air force pilot who parachuted down near the town after his plane crashed on Friday. The strikes against civilians are in retaliation against the execution of the pilot by Nusra Front said Said Seif al Qalamoni from the Free Syrian Armys (FSA) Shahid Ahmad Abdo brigade that operates in Jayrud alongside the al Qaedas Nusra Front and other groups. Rebels in a joint operations room targeted a main army base in the region with Russian-made surface to surface missiles after the aerial strikes al Qalamoni said. Syrian state media said the crash was due to a technical fault and the pilot had ejected while the rebel group Jaish al-Islam said it had shot down the plane but did not say how. Jaish al Islam said the pilot was arrested and was subsequently killed by a fighter from the Nusra Front while being held at a joint command center. The army had warned of a strong response after the execution of the pilot was reported shortly after he was shown on a rebel video circulated on social media giving details of his mission. Separately Russian and Syrian planes intensified their bombing on Saturday of a strategic rebel-held area of Aleppo that is near the only route into opposition-held parts of the northern city. If the Malah area were to fall to the army and its allies they would succeed in laying siege to areas where over 400000 people live under rebel control.

Tags Syria Idlib gas attack chlorine Observatory Assad Warplanes carried out a suspected toxic gas attack that killed at least 72 people including several children in a rebel-held town in northwestern Syria on Tuesday a monitoring group said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said those killed in the town of Khan Sheikhun in Idlib province had died from the effects of the gas adding that dozens more suffered respiratory problems and other symptoms. The Britain-based monitoring group was unable to confirm the nature of the substance and said it was unclear if the planes involved in the attack were Syrian or those of government ally Russia. The Observatory said medical sources in the town reported symptoms among the affected including fainting vomiting and foaming at the mouth. The victims were mostly civilians it said and included at least 20 children. Photographs circulated by activists showed members of the volunteer White Helmets rescue group using hoses to wash down the injured as well as at least two men with white foam around their mouths. Idlib province is largely controlled by an alliance of rebels including former al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front. A man gets treatment at a hospital after the chlorine gas attack in Idlib [Anadolu] It is regularly targeted in strikes by the regime as well as Russian warplanes and has also been hit by the US-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group usually targeting extremists. Syrias government officially joined the Chemical Weapons Convention and turned over its chemical arsenal in 2013 as part of a deal to avert US military action. But there have been repeated allegations of chemical weapons use by the government since then with a UN-led investigation pointing the finger at the regime for at least three chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. The government denies the use of chemical weapons and has in turn accused rebels of using banned weapons. The attack comes only days after forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad were accused of using chemical weapons in a counter-offensive in neighbouring Hama province. The opposition accused the government forces of using ""toxic substances"" in its battle to repel the assault. On Thursday airstrikes on several areas in the north of Hama province left around 50 people suffering respiratory problems according to the Observatory which could not confirm the cause of the symptoms. The monitor relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used.

A Syrian military source strongly denied the army had used any such weapons. The attack caused many people to choke or faint and some had foam coming out of their mouths the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said citing medical sources who described it as a sign of a gas attack. The air strikes on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the south of rebel-held Idlib also wounded more than 60 people said the Observatory a British-based war monitoring group. ""This morning at 630 a.m. warplanes targeted Khan Sheikhoun with gases believed to be sarin and chlorine"" said Mounzer Khalil head of Idlibs health authority adding that the attack had killed more than 50 people and wounded 300. ""Most of the hospitals in Idlib province are now overflowing with wounded people"" he told a news conference in Idlib. Warplanes later struck near a medical point where victims of the attack were being treated the Observatory said and civil defence workers said. The civil defence also known as the White Helmets - a rescue service that operates in opposition areas of Syria - said jets struck one of its centres in the area and the nearby medical point. It would mark the deadliest chemical attack in Syria since sarin gas killed hundreds of civilians in Ghouta near Damascus in August 2013. Western states said the Syrian government was responsible for that attack. Damascus blamed it on rebels. Military Denies The Syrian military source on Tuesday denied allegations that government forces had used chemical weapons dismissing the accounts as rebel propaganda. The army ""has not and does not use them not in the past and not in the future because it does not have them in the first place"" the source said. A joint inquiry for the United Nations and the global chemical weapons watchdog has previously accused government forces of toxic gas attacks. France called for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting about Tuesdays suspected attack. Reuters photographs showed people breathing through oxygen masks and wearing protection suits while others carried the bodies of dead children and corpses wrapped in blankets were lined up on the ground. Activists in northern Syria circulated pictures on social media showing a purported victim with foam around his mouth and rescue workers hosing down almost naked children squirming on the floor. Most of the towns streets had become empty a witness said. The conflict pits President Bashar al-Assads government helped by Russia and Iranian-backed militias against a wide array of rebel groups including some that have been supported by Turkey the United States and Gulf monarchies. The Russian Defence Ministry said on Tuesday that Russian planes had not carried out air strikes on Idlib. Syrian and Russian air strikes have battered parts of Idlib despite a ceasefire that Turkey and Russia brokered in December according to the Observatory. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the suspected attack Turkish presidential sources said. They said the two leaders had also emphasised the importance of maintaining the ceasefire. Population Ballooned Idlib province contains the largest populated area controlled by the anti-Assad rebels - both nationalist Free Syrian Army groups and Islamist factions including the former al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. Idlibs population has ballooned with thousands of fighters and civilians shuttled out of Aleppo city and areas around Damascus that the government has retaken in recent months. U.S. air strikes since January have also hit several areas in the rural province where jihadists have a powerful presence. The United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have been investigating whether Damascus is adhering to its commitments under the 2013 agreement which averted the threat of U.S.-led military intervention. In a report in October last year the inquiry said that government forces used chemical weapons at least three times in 2014-2015 and that Islamic State used mustard gas in 2015. Following the 2013 Ghouta attack the Syrian government joined the international Chemical Weapons Convention under a U.S.-Russian deal. The government which denied its forces were behind the Ghouta attack also agreed to hand over its declared stockpile of 1300 tonnes of toxic weaponry and dismantle its chemical weapons program under international supervision. Damascus has repeatedly denied using such weapons during the six-year war which has killed hundreds of thousands and created the worlds worst refugee crisis."

The attack came as Syrian opposition fighters and their allies battled government forces outside Aleppo in a bid to ease the regimes siege of rebel-held parts of the northern city. Russias defence ministry announced the downing of the helicopter which it said was carrying three crew and two officers. ""A Russian Mi-8 military transport helicopter was shot down from the ground after delivering humanitarian aid to Aleppo"" the defence ministry said in a statement quoted by Russian news agencies. The Kremlin said all five people on board were assumed dead. ""As far as we know from the information weve had from the defence ministry those in the helicopter died they died heroically because they were trying to move the aircraft away to minimise victims on the ground"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. Lieutenant General Sergei Rudskoy called the downing a ""terrorist act"" and said the defence ministry was still trying to confirm the fate of the Russian servicemen ""through all possible channels"". It was not immediately clear who was responsible. The incident was the deadliest single attack on Russian forces in Syria since Moscow began its intervention in support of President Bashar Assads government last September. It brought the total number of members of the Russian forces killed in Syria to 18. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitor said the helicopter had come down along the administrative border between Idlib province in the northwest and neighbouring Aleppo. Idlib is held almost entirely by a powerful coalition of Islamist and jihadist forces including the former Al Nusra Front now known as the Fateh Al Sham Front after renouncing its status as Al Qaedas Syrian affiliate. Aleppo rebel assault In neighbouring Aleppo province the Fateh Al Sham Front and allied rebel groups were fighting fierce battles on Monday against regime troops on the outskirts of Aleppo city. The clashes are part of an assault launched Sunday to try to ease a government siege of the rebel-held east of the city. The observatory said the rebels had advanced overnight south and southwest of Aleppo but reported ongoing fighting as well as government air strikes on the battlefield and rebel-held eastern neighbourhoods. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo city has been roughly divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012. In recent weeks government forces have encircled the east cutting the sole supply route in and raising fears of a humanitarian crisis for the estimated 250000 people now under siege there. The primary goal of the rebel assault is to seize the Ramussa neighbourhood on the citys southern outskirts. The road that runs through Ramussa is the main supply route for regime forces going to the areas they control in western Aleppo said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. It is also used by civilians to enter and leave government-controlled districts of Aleppo. Taking a detour from the north would be too dangerous he added. Islamist group Ahrar Al Sham said on Twitter it was involved in fierce clashes near Ramussa and advancing towards the route. State news agency SANA said rebel rocket and sniper fire near Ramussa on Monday killed four people including three women. The observatory put the toll at six dead. Humanitarian corridors SANA said people were using the route as usual but residents of western Aleppo expressed fears that the assault could cut them off. If the militants break the siege they will besiege us and cut the Khanasser route which is the only artery we have said Hossam Qassab a 32-year-old pharmacist. A Syrian security source acknowledged the assault but said government forces had repelled it. The encirclement of eastern Aleppo has raised fears of starvation for remaining residents who have reported food shortages and spiralling prices since the government siege began on July 17. Last week Moscow announced the opening of humanitarian corridors from the east into government territory for civilians and surrendering rebels. On Saturday Moscow and Syrian official media reported dozens of civilians had fled via these corridors but residents and rebels on the ground dismissed the reports as lies. Elsewhere in Aleppo province the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance advanced inside the Daesh terror group bastion of Manbij on Monday the observatory reported. The SDF hold approximately 40 per cent of the town and are fighting to take it with support from the US-led coalition against Daesh."

Seven militants from Syrias Al-Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front terrorist group including commanders were killed in US-led air strikes Wednesday in the northwest of the conflict-riven country a Britain-based opposition monitoring group said. The US-led raids in Syria which began last September have allegedly focused on the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) takfiri group but Al-Nusra Front terrorist organization has also been the target of some strikes. ""Seven Al-Nusra members including commanders were killed in at least five coalition air strikes against the groups bases and a vehicle in Idleb province"" the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Rami Abdel Rahman said. Most of Idleb province has been under the control of Al-Nusra and its terrorist allies. The United States is backing more moderate rebels in their fight against the Syrian regime. Like ISIL Al-Nusra is blacklisted as a ""terrorist organization"" by Washington. Syria was hit by a violent unrest since mid-March 2011 where the western media reports accuse countries mainly the USA Turkey Saudi Arabia and Qatar of orchestrating the civil conflict in the country and providing terrorist groups with money weapons and trained mercenaries. On May 2011 Syrian army launched a wide-scale operation against armed groups and gunmen operating in the country who started to escape the army blows and infiltrate illegally to Lebanon. "

""This is a tragedy. It is an outrage. And if deliberate it is a war crime"" said UNICEF director Anthony Lake. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) earlier said ""warplanes either Russia or Syrian carried out six strikes"" in the village of Hass including on a school complex killing at least 35 civilians including 11 schoolchildren. The White Helmets civil defence group released pictures of four rescue workers clambering over a mound of rubble in search of survivors after what it said was a ""double-tap"" strike on the school.

""One rocket hit the entrance of the school as students were leaving to go home after the school administration decided to end classes for the day because of the raids"" the activist said speaking on condition of anonymity. Lake said the school compound was ""repeatedly attacked"" adding that it may be the deadliest attack on a school since the war began more than five years ago.

""Its the easiest thing for me to say no but Im a responsible person so I need to see what my Ministry of Defence is going to say."" Syrian regime forces and their Russian ally have been accused by rights groups of carrying out indiscriminate attacks on civilian infrastructure. Intentional attack A leading opposition group condemned the raids. The Istanbul-based National Coalition said Russian and regime warplanes ""targeted children in their schools deliberately and intentionally hitting civilians with high-explosive material"". Idlib province is controlled by the Army of Conquest an alliance of opposition groups and militants including the Fateh al-Sham Front which changed its name from Al-Nusra Front after breaking off ties with Al Qaeda earlier this year.

Tags Syria Golan Heights Israeli airstrike Hezballah SOHR An Israeli airstrike on a government-held village on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights ceasefire line killed five pro-regime forces on Wednesday a monitoring group said. ""An Israeli plane hit a car inside the town of Hader killing two men from (Lebanese Shia group) Hezballah and three men from the pro-regime popular committees in the town"" said Rami Abdel Rahman director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Hader is a Druze village that lies along the ceasefire line with the Israeli-occupied portion of the Golan Heights plateau to the west and the border with Damascus province to the northeast. An Israeli army spokeswoman declined to comment on the incident. According to Hezballahs official television station al-Manar ""two members of Syrias (pro-regime militia) National Defence Forces were killed when an Israeli drone targeted their car at the entrance of Hader in Quneitra province."" The National Defence Forces has fighters operating throughout Syria. Lebanons Hezballah is a close ally of the Syrian government and has dispatched fighters to bolster the army against the uprising that began in March 2011. Rebel fighters including Islamists surrounded the village of Hader on June 17 after fierce clashes with loyalist militia in the area. Israels own significant Druze minority has expressed concern that their brethren in Syria would be targeted by rebels there. The Druze are a secretive offshoot of Shia Islam. Officials say there are 110000 of them in northern Israel and another 20000 in the Israeli-occupied Golan. Israel seized 1200 square kilometres (460 square miles) of the Golan Heights from neighbouring Syria in the 1967 Six Day War."

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was unclear if the strike on the rebel-held town in northwest Syrias Idlib province was carried out by Syrian planes or those of government ally Russia. The death was the first in the town since a suspected chemical weapons attack on Tuesday that killed 87 civilians including 31 children and left hundreds suffering symptoms including convulsions vomiting and foaming at the mouth. Much of the international community pointed the finger at President Bashar al-Assads government for the attack though it denied any responsibility. US President Donald Trump ordered the first direct US military action against Assads government in response to the attack launching missiles against an air base in central Syria. Khan Sheikhun has been hit several times since the Tuesday attack including in a strike in the hours afterwards on a hospital treating victims. Idlib province is largely held by an alliance of rebels including a former Al-Qaeda affiliate and is regularly targeted in Syrian and Russian air strikes. The US-led coalition fighting the Islamic State (IS) militant group has also carried out rare strikes in the province. More than 320000 people have been killed in Syria since its conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government demonstrations.

Tags Syria Free Syrian Army opposition groups Sawaiq al-Rahman brigade al-Nusra Front Idlib The Sawaiq al-Rahman brigade announced on Monday that it had killed six Nusra Front fighters and injured several others in the countryside south of Idlib in northwest Syria. The brigade is a Syrian opposition faction affiliated with the Free Syrian Army (FSA). ""The operation was carried out in response to al-Nusras attack on the town of Amiriyah when it set fire to several houses - including one belonging to Mithqal al-Abdallah a former Syrian Revolutionary Front (SRF) commander"" the Sawaiq al-Rahman brigade stated. 	 	Al-Nusra has many enemies. It also has many hostages including my son. - Col Haitham Afisi former FSA deputy chief of staff The brigade also recently killed Abu Hassan an al-Nusra leader in the town of Salqin in the countryside around Idlib. He was hanged for ""violations committed by al-Nusra against the towns civilians"" according to a statement issued by the brigade. The FSAs special forces seventh division also issued a statement giving al-Nusra 48 hours to release those it took hostage nearly a week ago when it stormed its headquarters in the town of Ain Larouz. Those taken include the divisions commander and several fighters. The statement also called on al-Nusra to return all possessions it had taken and to abide by ""the law of God"" to prevent further bloodshed. Former FSA Deputy Chief of Staff Colonel Haitham Afisi said that over the past eight months al-Nusra had also attacked fighters from groups including the FSA SRF Hazzm Maarat al-Noman martyrs brigade Idlib martyrs brigade and those led by Mithal al-Abdallah and Yusuf al-Hassan. ""Al-Nusra has many enemies. It also has many hostages including my son a brigade commander that has been detained for over four months"" Afisi told al-Araby al-Jadeed. The colonel said the group had lost popular support and become a target itself while that those it had attacked were likely to unite against it. The Nusra Front is an al-Qaeda franchise operating in Syria and Lebanon that aims to overthrow the regime of President Assad in Syria. The group has been designated ""a terrorist organisation"" by many western governments. In early November 2014 al-Nusra started expanding into the countryside around Idlib after clashing with other opposition factions particularly the SRF. Al-Nusra has since seized control of most of the countryside south of Idlib the provincial capital. This article is an edited translation from our Arabic edition."

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was not immediately clear whether the strikes on rebel-held Atareb had been carried out by Syrian warplanes or those of Damascuss ally Russia. The monitor said three strikes hit the towns market adding that the overall toll was expected to rise because dozens of people had been wounded or were still missing after the attack. A photographer contributing to AFP saw massive destruction at the scene with rubble from damaged buildings covering the street and panicked civilians carrying away the injured. Three men helped one of those hit in the attack his face drenched in blood and his features almost completely obscured. Nearby the body of a man in a blue shirt and dark trousers lay where he had died. Civil defence workers rushed alongside civilians to evacuate the injured with one man in a thick beanie hat carrying a wailing child in a pink sweater away from the scene. Elsewhere the bodies of at least three children were laid out on the ground partly covered by thick bolts of fabric. Atareb is in the west of Aleppo province in an area that is part of a ""de-escalation zone"" agreed under a deal earlier this year between Syrias allies Russia and Iran and rebel backer Turkey. The zone mostly covers neighbouring Idlib province which is largely held by opposition forces and a jihadist group formerly affiliated with Al-Qaeda. Despite the governments recapture of Aleppo city late last year rebel groups maintain a presence in the west of the province. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests."

__label__1	"__topic__2 Idlib bombing deadliest school attack in Syrias war Date of publication 27 October 2016 Airstrikes targeting a school complex in the town of Hass in Idlib province around noon on Wednesday may be the deadliest attack on a school since Syrias conflict began. The UN Childrens agency (UNICEF) said on Thursday that airstrikes targeting a school in Syrias rebel-held northern Idlib province early on Wednesday may be the deadliest attack on a school since Syrias conflict began nearly six years ago. Both first responders the Syrian Civil Defence and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights have reported that 35 people were killed by the attack which struck a school complex in the village of Hass around midday on Wednesday as children gathered outside preparing to return home. Among the dead were 22 children. UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake has called the airstrikes an ""outrage"" tantamount to a war crime."" The Syrian Civil Defence or White Helmets have said that the attack constituted a double tap. This occurs when a warplane carries out an initial bombing raid on a target and then waits for either signs of survivors or rescue workers to arrive before executing a second or more consequent attacks. ""One rocket hit the entrance of the school as students were leaving to go home after the school administration decided to end classes for the day because of the raids"" said a local activist speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity. Idlib province is controlled by the Army of Conquest an alliance of rebel groups and extremists including the Fateh al-Sham Front which changed its name from al-Nusra Front after breaking off ties with al-Qaeda earlier this year. In the last week as Syrian and Russian airstrikes over Aleppo have temporarily calmed amid a Russian-proposed humanitarian pause in the city airstrikes on rebel positions have increased in Idlib as the Syrian regime seeks to stymie opposition gains in the province. Seven days of airstrikes across the northwestern province had left more than 75 civilians dead and another 150 wounded according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Activists said that at least 19 civilians including women and children were killed and dozens more wounded in airstrikes believed to be carried out by the Russian air force on the village of Almehemdiya in western rural Deir Ezzor. The Syrian Coalition strongly condemned the attack on Almehemdiya and the targeting of civilians across Syria especially the escalating Russian aggression on Syria after rebels managed to break the siege on Aleppo. The Coalition rejected any and all excuses used to justify the bombings in Syria stressing that targeting civilians including women and children cannot not be justified by fighting terror. Whether it was with a knife or an aircraft any attack on civilians is terrorism pure and simple the Coalition added. Meanwhile over 10 civilians were also killed and 18 more wounded in Russian airstrikes and barrel bomb attacks on the neighborhoods of Karam Alnozha and Tal Alzarazir in Aleppo on Tuesday. Activists in Daraya west of Damascus said that the rebel-held district was pounded with a barrage of barrel bombs as well as artillery and rocket shells while violent clashes between FSA fighters and regime forces on the outskirts of the district were reported.

Syrian state TV said an explosive device went off in the northern city of Aleppo killing six people and wounding 30 others. It did not provide further details on Wednesdays blast in the regime-held Salaheddin neighborhood. Opposition media groups including Aleppo Today said the explosion occurred near a mosque during the funeral of a regime fighter. Aleppo was divided between regime and rebel-held districts for years but regime forces managed to drive rebels from the city in December with a Russian-backed offensive. Some contested areas remain. Meanwhile the widely criticized evacuation of thousands of Syrians from four besieged areas resumed Wednesday state media and activists said days after a bombing killed more than 120 evacuees and delayed the population transfer. The Central Military Media said 3000 residents of two pro-regime villages Foua and Kafarya left Wednesday in 45 buses bound for regime-controlled Aleppo. Another 11 buses carrying some 500 people including opposition fighters left Madaya and Zabadani near Damascus heading toward the northern rebel-held Idlib province. The opposition-run Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported the transfer which it said includes 800 armed men from both the rebels and regime. Some 160 mostly gunmen had remained in Zabadani. The process has resumed with 3000 people leaving Foua and Kafraya at dawn and nearly 300 leaving Zabadani and two other rebel-held areas the head of the Britain-based monitoring group Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. Security was tightened up for Wednesdays departures. Several dozen armed rebel fighters stood guard over the marshalling area where the buses were parked. The AFP correspondent said all other vehicles were carefully searched. After repeated delays the first phase of the deal began on Friday. Some 30 hours after the first two batches reached exchange points a massive explosion struck near buses carrying evacuees from the pro-regime areas killing more than 120 mostly women and children. Many of the rebel fighters who guarded the buses were also killed. No one claimed responsibility for the attack which the regime blamed on the rebels. The transfer deal is not overseen by the United Nations. Critics say the string of evacuations which could see some 30000 people moved across battle lines over the next 60 days rewards siege tactics and amounts to forced displacement along political and sectarian lines. All four areas have been under siege for years their fate linked through a series of reciprocal agreements that the UN says have hindered aid deliveries.

__label__1	"__topic__2 19 civilians killed in Assad regime bombing near Damascus Published November 26 2017 Assad regime air strikes and artillery fire killed 19 civilians on Sunday across the opposition-held Eastern Ghouta region outside the capital Damascus a monitor said. The deaths come despite the area falling within the ""de-escalation zone"" put in place under a deal between regime allies Russia and Iran and opposition-backer Turkey. Eastern Ghouta is already in the grip of a humanitarian crisis caused by a crushing regime siege of the area since 2013 that has caused food and medical shortages. On Sunday regime air strikes on the areas of Mesraba and Madira killed 17 civilians while artillery fire on the town of Douma killed another two civilians the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. ""The toll could rise further because of the number of wounded people in serious condition"" said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. Regime bombardment of Eastern Ghouta in the last two weeks has killed more than 100 people according to the Observatory. Rebels have also fired from the region into Damascus killing several people. Humanitarian access to Eastern Ghouta has remained limited despite the implementation of the truce zone and a United Nations official referred to the region as the ""epicenter of suffering"" in Syria. More than 340000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests."
__label__0	__topic__2 Dozens dead as warplanes pound rebel-held north Syria | Jordan Times Last updated at Aug 142016 BEIRUT Syrian and Russian warplanes have launched a wave of air strikes in northern Syria killing dozens in areas held by a rebel alliance battling to take control of second city Aleppo. The air strikes which began Saturday and continued Sunday killed 45 civilians in and around Aleppo and 22 in neighbouring Idlib province the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The raids came as the Faylaq Al Sham Islamist faction part of the rebel alliance said it had begun a new offensive to liberate the regime-held district of Zahra on Aleppos western outskirts. The Britain-based observatory and opposition fighters said a car bomb exploded in Zahra Sunday but did not mention casualties. The monitor said the air strikes targeted areas held by the Army of Conquest an alliance of rebel Islamist and militant forces that has mounted a major Aleppo offensive. The intensification of the strikes in Idlib is due to the fact that this province is the main source of fighters for the Army of Conquest said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. An AFP correspondent in rebel-held eastern Aleppo said the strikes were especially intense around the southern district of Ramussa seized by rebels earlier this month in a major setback for forces loyal to President Bashar Assad. Nine other civilians were killed in rebel shelling of regime-held western Aleppo Saturday the observatory said. Aleppo Syrias former economic hub and a focal point of its five-year civil war has been divided between a rebel-held east and regime-controlled west since mid-2012. Intensifying battle Fighting for the city has intensified after regime troops seized control of the last supply route into rebel-held areas in mid-July. After a nearly three-week siege rebels took Ramussa on August 6 linking up with opposition-held neighbourhoods. Emboldened by the success the Army of Conquest announced an ambitious bid to capture all of Aleppo which if successful would be the biggest opposition victory yet in Syrias conflict. Alliance fighters late Sunday began an assault southeast of Ramussa on an area containing a former cement plant turned into an army barracks where a large amount of weapons and military vehicles are stored the observatory said. The rebels want to secure the supply line they opened last week into rebel districts Abdel Rahman said. The increased fighting has raised concerns for the estimated 1.5 million civilians still in Aleppo including some 250000 in rebel-held areas. The United Nations has called for regular 48-hour pauses in the fighting to allow aid into the city which has suffered from severe shortages of food water and medical supplies. Russia began air strikes last September in support of Assad helping the regime to consolidate its hold on loyal areas and regain some territory. The defence ministry in Moscow said on Sunday six long-range bombers from Russia had struck around Deir Ezzor a stronghold of the Daesh terror group. Daesh controls large parts of Deir Ezzor city and most of the oil-rich eastern province of the same name part of the swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq that it seized in mid-2014. Girl evacuated The ministry said the Russian Tupolev bombers carried out raids southwest east and northeast of the city wiping out two command posts six arms depots IS vehicles and a large number of fighters. Daesh emerged amid the chaos of Syrias conflict a complex and multi-front war that has killed more than 290000 and displaced millions since beginning with anti-regime protests in March 2011. A US-led coalition is also battling Daesh in Syria and Iraq with air strikes and backing for the Syrian Democratic Forces an Arab-Kurdish militia alliance which on Friday took full control of the strategic city of Manbij after Daesh retreated. The extremists took some 2000 civilians as they fled to serve as human shields. Hundreds were released on Saturday but the SDF said the fate of many remained unclear. On Sunday the SDF said they had established a military council to push Daesh militants out of Al Bab the alliances next target in the same province. In rare good news a 10-year-old girl shot in the besieged town of Madaya was evacuated to a Damascus hospital where she was in a stable condition the observatory and a security source said. Ghina Quwayders leg was shattered when she was shot by a government sniper at a checkpoint in the southwestern town earlier this month while buying medicine for her mother Amnesty International said.
__label__1	"__topic__2 Rebel fire in Syrias Aleppo kills 14 State media Wednesday 10 Aug 2016 Rebel fire in Syrias Aleppo kills 14 State media AFP A barrage of rocket fire from Syrian rebels killed at least 14 people and left dozens wounded Wednesday in government-held neighbourhoods of divided Aleppo city state media said. Fighting struck the southern edges of the battered city Wednesday night as opposition fighters and regime forces gear up for a major protracted battle that could mark a turning point in the five-year war. Syrian state news agency SANA said rebel fire on the regime-controlled district of Hamdaniyeh on Wednesday killed 13 people and wounded 25 others. Rocket attacks on another government-held neighbourhood killed one person and wounded 12 others earlier in the day. SANA said Russian and government planes targeted ""terrorist"" positions in the citys south as an AFP journalist in Aleppo said intense air strikes and artillery fire could be heard. But it was unclear if the major push for control of the city had begun. An estimated 1.2 million people live in zones controlled by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in Aleppo with about 250000 people in the rebel-held eastern districts. Residents across the city have been living in fear of competing sieges since fighting surged in late June over rival access routes into Aleppo. Russias military announced a three-hour daily halt of fighting starting on Thursday to allow humanitarian convoys to reach Aleppo but the UNs top aid official said it would not be enough. The United Nations has called for a fully-fledged ceasefire or at least 48-hour weekly pauses for aid deliveries. Once Syrias economic hub Aleppo has been ravaged by fighting since mid-2012 just one year after the countrys conflict erupted."

In Turkish airstrikes and artilleries attacks on two villages near Jerablus 40 civilian killed and more than 110 others wounded. Also Turkish Army killed 25 Kurdish YPG fighters calling them Terrorist. On Sunday Turkish forces ramped up their offensive with Turkish warplanes and artillery pounding areas held by pro-Kurdish forces close to Jarablus liberated from ISIS this week.

__label__0	__topic__2 Syria Kurdish Islamist violence kills 12 Al-Qaeda-linked fighters Posted on August 3 2013 by Nazeer Rida At least 12 Islamist fighters were killed in clashes with Kurdish militants in the Syrian city of Hasaka early Friday the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said. Clashes erupted on Friday at midnight between fighters from the Peoples Protection Units (YPG) on the one hand and fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and the Al-Nusra Front on the other hand the SOHR announced. Fridas fighting came after renewed tensions between the two sides in Kurdish-dominated areas to the north and east of Syria. This is not the first time that Islamists linked to Al-Qaeda and Kurdish militants have fought since the Syrian crisis erupted in 2011. Rebel-on-rebel violence has been frequent in areas along the Turkish border and last month witnessed heavy clashes in the oil-rich city of Ras Al-Ayn in northeastern Syria. The ArabKurdish crisis appears to include the Free Syrian Army (FSA). A video posted on the internet showed Col. Abdul Jabbar Akidi a member of the FSA military council announcing that the FSA has sent reinforcement to Islamists. This cannot be tolerated. If it is necessary we will wipe out the PKK he said referring to the Kurdistan Workers Party. Viewed as the largest Kurdish political and military formation in Syria the Democratic Union Party (PYD) dismissed Akidis statement as unjustified. Speaking exclusively to Asharq Al-Awsat PYD spokesman Nawaf Khalil said that reasons for Akidis calls to fight Kurds are unknown and that the PKK has clearly announced that the Syrian regime and its supporters have lost legitimacy. This attack is meant to be against the entire Kurdish region on the pretext of fighting the PKK Khalil said stressing that Kurds will fight those who attack them. The PYD the Syrian franchise of the Turkish PKK is believed to stand as the largest political and military formation in Syria and has assumed control over the Kurdish-dominated areas to the east and north of Syria since July 2012 setting up checkpoints and running public affairs. Khalil reaffirmed to Asharq Al-Awsat the PYDs despire to topple the regime as well as its opposition to the Al-Qaeda-linked rebel groups such as the Al-Nusra Front. We did not want to go into battles with the Islamists particularly after the agreement we signed with them but today they are laying siege to us in addition to the siege laid by the Syrian regime on the one hand and Turkey along the borders on the other the PYD spokesman said. He added The stances of the opposition and the FSA serve the interests of the dictatorial regime. They should have looked for a formula to deal cooperate and even coordinate on the ground with the Kurdish side in the face of the regimes aggression. We work to topple the regime and coordinate with all sides but we will not accept the Islamists the regime army or the FSA entering our area. In other news the UN said it would probe reports opposition fighters committed a massacre against troops loyal to Assad in Khan Al-Assal after seizing the strategic town from the regime last week UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in a statement. After examining videos documenting the atrocities committed by rebels Pillay said These images if verified suggest that executions were committed in Khan Al-Assal calling for a thorough independent investigation to establish whether war crimes have been committed. She also warned that all sides in Syria should not think they are immune from prosecution. Nazeer Rida

Mohammad al-Shaar Syrias interior minister told reporters that two ""terrorists"" attacked the police station in the al-Midan neighborhood of Damascus with a number of bombs on Monday before one of them blew himself up. He said the other bomber made it inside the compound where police killed him causing his bomb to explode. The blasts damaged the lower floors of the building and shattered the windows along one side. Blood stained the floors. The interior ministry also reported the attack saying two suicide bombers had blown themselves up killing civilians and police officers but giving no precise toll. Pro-Assad regime state media said earlier that a ""terrorist explosion"" struck the al-Midan neighborhood in Damascus. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack."

__label__1	__topic__2 Saudi-backed rebels behind Syria chemical attack report Sat Aug 31 2013 Saudi-backed rebels behind Syria chemical attack report. Rebels and local residents in Syrias Ghouta say Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan provided chemical weapons to an al-Qaeda-linked armed group. Interviews with people in Damascus and Ghouta a suburb of the Syrian capital where the humanitarian agency Doctors Without Borders said at least 355 people had died last week from what it believed to be a neurotoxic agent indicated the Saudi-backed militants could be responsible for the recent deadly chemical attack in Syria. The US has been moving its warships closer to Syria russhing to bomb army and government bases based on conflicting reports over an alleged chemical attack in Ghouta near capital Damascus. However from numerous interviews with doctors Ghouta residents militant fighters and their families a different picture emerges the Mint Press News reported. Many of the residents believe that certain militants received chemical weapons via the Saudi intelligence chief Prince Bandar bin Sultan and were responsible for carrying out the gchemical attack. My son came to me two weeks ago asking what I thought the weapons were that he had been asked to carry said Abu Abdel-Moneim the father of a militant fighting to unseat the Syrian government who lives in Ghouta. Abdel-Moneim said his son and 12 other militants were killed inside of a tunnel used to store weapons provided by a Saudi militant known as Abu Ayesha who was leading a fighting battalion. The father described the weapons as having a tube-like structure while others were like a huge gas bottle. Ghouta townspeople said the militants were using mosques and private houses to sleep while storing their weapons in tunnels. Abdel-Moneim said his son and the others died during the chemical weapons attack. That same day the terrorist Jabhat al-Nusra which is linked to al-Qaeda announced that it would similarly attack civilians in the Syrian government heartland of Latakia on its western coast in purported retaliation. It tell us what these arms were or how to use them complained a female fighter named We didnt know they were chemical weapons. We never imagined they were chemical weapons.When Saudi Prince Bandar gives such weapons to people he must give them to those who know how to handle and use them she warned. She like other Syrians does not want to use their full names for fear of retribution. A well-known militant leader in Ghouta named agreed. Jabhat al-Nusra militants do not cooperate with other militants except with fighting on the ground. They do not share secret information. They merely used some ordinary militants to carry and operate this material he said. We were very curious about these arms. And unfortunately some of the fighters handled the weapons improperly and set off the explosions said. Doctors who treated the chemical weapons attack victims cautioned interviewers to be careful about asking questions regarding who was responsible for the deadly assault. The humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders added that health workers aiding 3600 patients also reported experiencing similar symptoms including frothing at the mouth respiratory distress convulsions and blurry vision. The group has not been able to independently verify the information. More than a dozen militants interviewed reported that their salaries came from the Saudi government.

Fifteen of the dead among them four of the children came in the barrel bomb strike on a rebel-held district of the divided northern city the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. ""The children were aged under 10"" said Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman adding that a pregnant woman was also among Wednesdays dead. The crude explosives-filled container hit a building in the northeastern neighbourhood of Karam al-Beik as residents were sitting down to the iftar meal which breaks the daytime fast observed during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The other four civilians were killed by rebel rocket fire on the government-held district of Midane the Observatory said. For the past three years Syrias pre-war economic hub has been divided between a government-held western sector and a rebel-held eastern one. The rebels launched a major offensive in the first week of July to try to advance the front line. More than 220000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began with anti-government protests in March 2011 that were met with a bloody crackdown."

Tags Syria Assad US Russia ceasefire Aleppo Suspected Syrian regime and Russian airstrikes in Aleppo province killed at least 22 Red Crescent [SARC] volunteers including a senior official as well as killing and injuring a number of civilians local sources said late on Monday. The strikes also damaged trucks carrying supplies. The attack was later confirmed by the UN. The renewed regime bombardment of rebel-held parts of Aleppo broken earlier by The New Arab and described by sources as relentless follows the collapse of a fragile ceasefire in place since Monday. ""Russian warplanes targeted an international aid convoy escorted by SARC killing 22 volunteers"" local activist Mohammad al-Halabi told The New Arab. Halabi confirmed the dead included SARCs chief in Aleppo province. According to Reuters the aid convoy was struck while traveling to Orem in Aleppo governorate. The agency quoted a United Nations spokesman late on Monday. The spokesman could not confirm if it was an airstrike. Syrian or Russian warplanes bombed aid trucks near Aleppo late on Monday after a fragile week-long ceasefire ended the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported. The aid convoy of at least ten trucks was believed to have been carrying tonnes of much-needed humanitarian supplies and food from the UN. Reports suggest the aircraft doubled back after attacking the convoy and targeted rescue workers arriving on the scene. 	 	Syrias army announces the end of the freeze on fighting that began at 7pm (1600 GMT) on September 12 2016 in accordance with the US-Russia agreement	 	 Regime renews onslaught Elsewhere airstrikes have targeted at least five neighbourhoods in the rebel-held east of Aleppo city after the Syrian regime declared the end of the ceasefire. The bombing on Monday evening has trapped civilians in destroyed buildings and the ""White Helmets"" civil defence volunteers are searching for survivors under the rubble a resident told The New Arab. Artillery shelling was also reported to the south of the city. The freeze on fighting brokered by the United States and Russia lasted a week. Syrias armed forces on Monday blamed rebel groups for its failure. ""Syrias army announces the end of the freeze on fighting that began at 7pm (1600 GMT) on September 12 2016 in accordance with the US-Russia agreement"" the statement carried by state news agency SANA said. It said rebel groups ""did not commit to a single element"" of the deal. A contributor to The New Arab based in Aleppo reported at least five regime air raids in the space of ten minutes at around 800pm not long after the end of the ceasefire was announced. The truce had come into force on the evening of September 12. The main battlefronts subsequently saw a marked reduction in violence but clashes broke out late last week in the central provinces of Hama and Homs as well as east of Damascus. The deal was further strained by US-led coalition strikes on Syrian army positions in the east that killed dozens of government soldiers which Washington said was not intentional. On Sunday the cessation of hostilities was hanging by a thread after a fresh wave of air raids hit rebel-held districts of the battleground city of Aleppo killing one woman. These images sent from east Aleppo earlier on Monday by journalist Zouhir al-Shimale show eerily deserted streets as the Syrian armed forces declared the end of the ceasefire. Zouhir told The New Arab that residents who have been under regime siege despite the ceasefire see ""no clear vision for the near future in the city"". Just two hours later the bombing began again in earnest. Agencies contributed Read Also"

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday global powers were on the right track with a plan to eliminate Syrias chemical weapons and could avert military intervention in the conflict if they worked together. Agreement on the plan to eliminate Syrias chemical weapons was reached after U.S. President Barack Obama asked Congress to approve air strikes to punish Syrias government over an August 21 gas attack the United States says killed more than 1400 people. There is every reason to believe we are on the right track Putin told an investment conference. He said the chemical weapons plan which has rekindled an effort to convene an international conference to seek a solution to the conflict could not have been put in place without support from Obama and the leaders of many countries. Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during the VTB Capital Investment Forum Russia Calling in Moscow October 2 2013. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov I believe that if we continue to act in such a coordinated way it will not be necessary to use force and increase the number of people wounded and killed in the long-suffering land of Syria said Putin. Russia has been Syrian President Bashar al-Assads strongest backer during the civil war blocking a number of Western initiatives in the U.N. Security Council and blaming the August 21 gas attack on rebel forces. Russia has emphasized that rebels fighting Assad must also abide by the chemical weapons agreement and made clear it would demand proof of government responsibility for any future attack before approving punishment in the Security Council.

Informed sources said the terrorist commanders were killed on Thursday during fierce fighting which broke out in Qalamoun located on Damascus countryside Lebanons al-Manar TV channel reported. In a post on its Twitter account Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah identified one of those slain as Abu Obaida adding that the militant was killed in Syrias southwestern town of Serghaya. In another development on Thursday Syrian troops and Hezbollah fighters managed to completely wrest control over the Mallah farms near the northwestern city of Aleppo. They further recaptured the Castello road which was used by terrorists as a strategic path to the eastern neighborhoods of Aleppo. Meanwhile SANA news agency reported that the Syrian army managed to foil an attack by the Takfiri ISIS terrorists on a number of military posts in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor. Syria has been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. Lebanon is also suffering from the spillover of militancy in neighboring Syria. Hezbollah fighters have been assisting Syrian army forces in fending off several terrorist attacks. Hezbollah and the Syrian military began a joint offensive on the Lebanon-Syria border last year to dislodge the ISIS and Nusra Front militants from the area. The Lebanese army also strikes the extremists hideouts on a nearly daily basis. SSH 11

The attack which also wounded dozens of people occurred in the neighbourhood of Salihiah ahead of the Eid al-Fitr festival. It was not immediately clear who carried out the attack but Daesh terrorist group has claimed previous bombings in the mainly Kurdish region. Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attack killed at least 16 people and wounded another 40. The death toll was confirmed to an AFP correspondent. The suicide attacker reportedly detonated his explosives in front of the bakery. ""A suicide bomber on a motorcycle blew himself up in the Salihiah neighbourhood of Hasakeh city"" said Abdel Rahman. Fifteen of the wounded were in critical condition said the head of the Britain-based group that relies on a network of sources on the ground for its information. Hasakeh city is the capital of the province of the same name. Nearly all of the province is controlled by the PKKs Syrian affiliate PYD and its armed wing YPG terrorist organization. The militants have declared an autonomous region across the mainly Kurdish northern areas they hold. A US-backed alliance of Kurds and Arabs The Syrian Democratic Forces alliance has been locked in battle in the neighbouring province of Aleppo for control of the Daesh stronghold of Manbij for more than one month. The SDF launched the offensive in late May and encircled the town and entered its southwestern districts on June 23.

Tags Syria Aleppo Russia airstrikes US ceasefire Hundreds of people including civilians have been killed as Russian and Syrian jets continued on Monday to pound rebel-held areas of Syrias Aleppo for the fourth day in a row. The death toll reached 330 overnight civil defence sources told The New Arab as airstrikes targeted the citys opposition-controlled areas after midnight on Sunday. ""Hospitals that are still in service are under a lot of pressure due to the significant number of wounded in recent days and the major shortage of blood"" one medic told AFP. ""Because of this serious injuries are requiring immediate amputations."" The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights placed the death toll lower saying ""at least 128 people"" nearly all civilians had been killed in the raids since Thursday. Among the dead were 20 children and nine women said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. At least 36 civilians including 11 children and five women were killed in raids targeting rural areas of Aleppo province he said. 	 	Hospitals that are still in service are under a lot of pressure due to the significant number of wounded in recent days.	 	 Hospitals in rebel-held east Aleppo are struggling to deal with a huge number of casualties as supplies dwindle. Monday was the fourth day of intense air raids on the city after a defiant Syrian regime launched a new assault to retake the entirety of the city following the collapse of a short-lived ceasefire brokered by Russia and the United States. With Aleppo again under siege - regime forces fully surrounded the city in early September - residents have to deal with food shortages and skyrocketing prices as well as the increased violence.

__label__1	"__topic__2 Syrian army advances near Aleppo Published February 18 2015 The Syrian army backed by allied militia has captured several villages north of Aleppo from insurgents and fighting has blocked a main supply route leading into the northern city a monitoring group said on Tuesday. A U.N. mediator has been struggling to broker a ceasefire in Aleppo and government forces had long been expected to try to encircle it completely aiming to drive insurgents from Syrias second city and take control of their main supply road. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said pro-government forces had blocked a road leading towards the Turkish border as heavy clashes continued there. The army also took villages including Bashkuwi and Sifat while battles raged in Hardatain and Ratain said the Observatory which tracks the Syrian conflict using sources on the ground. It added that at least 16 insurgents were killed. Aleppo is at the heart of clashes between pro-government forces and a range of insurgents which include extremist brigades al Qaedas hardline Syria wing Nusra Front foreign fighters in other groups and Western-backed rebels. ""It is very important because if they continue like this they will completely cut the supply lines for the future. The Syrian regime is moving forward there"" the Observatorys founder Rami Abdulrahman said. More than 210000 people have died in the Syrian conflict which will enter its fifth year next month the Observatory has estimated with fighting between numerous factions regularly flaring across the country. Villages and towns outside Aleppo have passed between pro-government and insurgent fighters before. Insurgent-held districts in the divided city have come under heavy air force bombardment while Syrian state television said on Tuesday that five people had been killed and 18 wounded in ""terrorist"" rocket attacks in Aleppo neighborhoods. A television channel run by Lebanese group Hezbollah which is fighting alongside pro-government units reported that the Syrian army had taken control of areas north of Aleppo. The Observatory said Hezbollah was involved in the battle. The pro-government al-Watan newspaper said on Monday that government forces aimed to completely surround the city this week in a major offensive against insurgent groups. In December mainly extremist insurgent factions in Aleppo grouped together to form Jabhat al-Shamiyya the Levant Front an attempt at unity among their fighters. Last month the Western-backed rebel group Hazzm movement joined the alliance after coming under pressure from Nusra Front. Recent Syrian army progress in the area has reduced the chances of a truce between the government and disparate insurgent groups diplomats say. Since October U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura has been working on a plan to broker ""local freezes"" in Syria."

__label__1	__topic__2 Hundreds dead as Islamic State seizes Syrian air base: monitor Sylvia Westall August 24 2014 Hundreds dead as Islamic State seizes Syrian air base: monitor Sylvia Westall. Islamic State militants stormed an air base in northeast Syria on Sunday capturing it from government forces after days of fighting that cost more than 500 lives a monitoring group said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 346 Islamic State fighters were killed and more than 170 members of government forces had died since Tuesday in the fight over Tabqa base making it one of the deadliest confrontations between the two groups since the start of Syrias war. The Observatory which monitors violence in Syria through sources on the ground said fighting raged inside the air base on Sunday. It was the Syrian armys last foothold in an area otherwise controlled by Islamic State which has seized large areas of Syria and Iraq. In nearby Raqqa city an Islamic State stronghold there was celebratory gunfire and several mosques announced through their loudspeakers that the base had fallen to the Islamists and cheered God is greatest a witness told Reuters. IS fighters displayed the severed heads of Syrian army soldiers in the city square the witness said adding that Syrian warplanes were heard over Raqqa following the air base attack. Earlier on Sunday the Syrian air force had bombed areas around the base. Syrian state television said that after fierce battles the military was regrouping. Citing a military source it said there was a successful evacuation of the airport and that the army was continuing strikes on terrorist groups in the area which it said had suffered heavy losses. Syrian state media gave no figure for the number of people killed in the clashes. Islamic State had also trapped around 150 retreating Syrian soldiers in an area near the base and was believed to be holding them captive the Observatory said. Residents of Tabqa city tour the streets on motorcycles carrying flags in celebration after Tabqa air base fell to Islamic State militants in nearby Raqqa city August 24 2014. REUTERS/Stringer The Syrian army sent reinforcements to the base overnight on Friday to fight Islamic State which controls roughly a third of northern and eastern Syria. Syrian television had shown footage of army forces defending the base on Saturday who had said it was safe from Islamic States advances. Many of the Islamic State fighters died after Syrian warplanes bombarded the area the Observatory said. MILITARY BASES Slideshow (3 Images) Islamic State a radical offshoot of al Qaeda has taken three Syrian military bases in the area in recent weeks boosted by arms seized in Iraq. Syria is calculating that the IS push to reshape the Middle East will eventually force the West to deal with President Bashar al-Assad as the only way to tackle the threat sources familiar with Syrian government thinking have said. Elsewhere in Syria the group withdrew from northern areas it controlled outside the city of Homs on Sunday and retreated east after coming under attack from rival Islamist fighters the Observatory said. Fighters from the group withdrew from a headquarters north of Homs on the orders of their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the Observatory said citing sources in the area. They said IS gave up the territory to Nusra Front al Qaedas official wing in Syria. As well as Nusra Front Western-backed rebels have also been fighting IS in Syria but have regularly been defeated by the group which in June declared an Islamic caliphate in the territory it controls. Activists have accused the Syrian army of avoiding confrontations with IS because it has weakened rival rebel groups also battling Assad.

The province is largely under rebel control outside its capital Idlib city. The strikes outside Saraqeb hit an area where civilians were sheltering after fleeing repeated government air strikes on the city the Observatory said. Footage of the aftermath of the attack in Ehsim posted on YouTube by activists showed desperate civilians trying to dig out a man buried up to his neck in the rubble of a collapsed building.

There were no immediate details on the breakdown of those killed in the strikes which are the latest to hit the town of Douma in the rebel stronghold of Eastern Ghouta. The opposition bastion east of Damascus came under a massive government aerial assault on Thursday after rebels fired more than 120 rockets and mortar rounds into the capital. The rebel barrage killed 10 people in Damascus including a child while the government air strikes and surface-to-surface missiles fired at Eastern Ghouta killed at least 82 people among them 18 children.

The blast in the town of Ariha in northwestern Syria went off as members of the Nusra Front gathered at the mosque for iftar the meal with which Muslims break their fast during the holy month of Ramadan. Observatory which tracks the war said the explosion in Salem Mosque in Ariha also killed a senior non-Syrian member of the Nusra Front. Opposition-based social media websites had conflicting casualty figures with some saying more than 40 people were dead. Turkeys state-run Ananolu Agency reported 15 deaths citing a statement from Istanbul-based Syrian Revolution General Commission. No group announced responsibility for the blast but supporters of Nusra Front blamed rival self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (ISIS) militants who have fought the group on several frontlines in Syria. A coalition of rebel groups called Jaish al Fateh or Conquest Army in which Nusra Front is a major part of its composition have controlled most of Idlib province since the capture of the provincial capital in March. The region borders Turkey and neighbors President Bashar al-Assads heartland in Latakia province on the Mediterranean coast.

The children aged from four to 10 and women were killed Thursday ""in barrel bomb strikes by regime helicopters on a home and public hall in the village of Tal Qarrah in the north of Aleppo"" the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The bombing also destroyed civilian property and wounded several people some of them critically the Britain-based Observatory added. President Bashar al-Assads air force has carried out near-daily strikes against areas under rebel control in the northern province since last December killing several hundred people mostly civilians. Rights groups have repeatedly criticised the use of barrel bombs which they say fail to discriminate between civilian and military targets. In July Human Rights Watch accused the regime of defying a UN Security Council resolution ordering all sides in Syrias war to stop indiscriminate attacks. Syrias multi-front war began as a peaceful movement demanding democratic change but morphed into an all-out civil war after Assads regime unleashed a brutal crackdown against dissent. More than 180000 people have been killed since March 2011 and nearly half the population have fled their homes."

""A truck packed with explosives detonated... near a branch of the military intelligence killing at least five people and injuring more than 20"" the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Syrian state television also reported the blast saying four people had been killed and 22 wounded in a ""terrorist explosion"" at the southern entrance of the city. In the northern province of Raqa two suicide bombers exploded inside base 17 an army base under siege by opposition forces according to the Observatory a Britain-based group that relies on activists and other witnesses inside Syria. The group said two fighters from the jihadist Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant had blown themselves up at the headquarters which is north of the groups stronghold in Raqas provincial capital. Clashes between regime forces and ISIL broke out after the blasts which the Observatory said killed several soldiers. In Damascus meanwhile the group said a man died after regime shelling a day earlier on the Palestinian Yarmuk camp where a ceasefire has broken down. The renewed fighting has halted aid delivery efforts to the besieged camp where two more people died from lack of food and medical care on Wednesday the Observatory said. Around 130 people are reported to have died because of shortages in the camp caused by the tight army siege. More than 140000 people are estimated to have been killed since the start of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011."

A woman and her three children as well as another child were killed when helicopters dropped a barrel bomb on the village of Taduf said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Taduf which lies in the northeast of Syrias Aleppo province is controlled by the Daesh terror group. In the provinces west eight civilians including three children were killed when regime warplanes struck the village of Daret Izza held by Islamist fighters and other rebels. Regime forces are continuing to kill civilians through aerial attacks with barrel bombs or shells indifferent to the international resolutions on this matter said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. He said the attacks amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by regime forces on a daily basis. Abdel Rahman told AFP the bombing campaign was an effort by the regime to turn civilians against the opposition factions or against IS with the reasoning that the aerial attacks are a result of the presence of fighters inside their towns and villages. The regime has stepped up air attacks in Aleppo province in recent days killing at least 57 civilians when it dropped container bombs on the Daesh-held town of Al Bab at the weekend. Also Wednesday 22 Daesh fighters were killed when regime warplanes struck a convoy traveling between the provinces of Deir Ezzor in the east and Hasakeh in the northeast. According to the observatory the jihadists were all Syrians from Deir Ezzor.

The Observatory said several prisoners being held by Ahrar al-Sham at a facility in the complex were also believed to have been killed but it had no immediate toll. The blast destroyed three buildings and people were still missing under the rubble the monitor added.

__label__0	__topic__2 Air strikes kill 4 in Syria _truce zone_ _ monitor | Jordan Times Last updated at Nov 022017 BEIRUT Syrian government air strikes killed at least four civilians including a child in a rebel-held town in a de-escalation zone outside the capital Damascus on Thursday a monitor said. The strikes hit the town of Douma which lies in the Eastern Ghouta region where a truce deal agreed by regime allies Iran and Russia and rebel backer Turkey has been in place since July. Despite the deal there has been an uptick in government bombardment of the area in recent days. Humanitarian groups have also warned of a malnutrition crisis in the area which is under a tight government siege. Regime planes fired rockets on several parts of Douma said Rami Abdel Rahman director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitor. Four civilians were killed including a child he said adding that 21 others were wounded. An AFP photographer saw some of the wounded being treated at a local medical facility where some of the dead were also being received. Ziad 13 suffered a head injury after being caught up in the strike on his way home. I was coming back from school when the first strike hit and I hid in a doorway he told AFP. The plane came back a second time and I tried to get down to the basement but the force of the second strike knocked the door closed and it injured my head and nose. Up to 400000 people are believed to live in Eastern Ghouta which has been under government siege since 2013. The blockade has caused serious food and medicine shortages and pushed the prices for what remains beyond the reach of impoverished residents. At least two children are reported to have died from malnourishment or related complications in recent weeks and more than 1100 other children are reportedly suffering acute malnutrition. On Monday several dozen trucks carrying assistance for 40000 people entered Eastern Ghouta as part of a United Nations-Syrian Arab Red Crescent convoy. It was the first aid access since September despite repeated requests from the UN and humanitarian actors for consistent access to besieged areas like Eastern Ghouta. On Tuesday 11 people including six school children were killed in regime shelling on the town of Jisreen in Eastern Ghouta the observatory said. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests.

(TRT World and Agencies) Syrian regime or Russian air strikes in and around a town in opposition-held Idlib province on Tuesday killed 26 people and severely damaged a hospital a monitoring group said. The attacks came as Syrian regime forces and Russian jets intensified their bombardment of Idlib the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. A spokesman at the hospital in Kafr Takharim in Idlib said an air strike hit its courtyard killing 14 people including patients. Separate air strikes southwest of Kafr Takharim killed at least 12 people including civilians and rebel fighters the Observatory said. The United Nations condemned the air strikes and called for an end to such attacks on hospitals. ""It is completely unacceptable that facilities and people who are trying to save lives are being bombed"" said Kevin Kennedy Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Syria Crisis. ""It must stop"" he added. The Observatory said there were no deaths from the hospital strike but that the bombardment had put it out of action. Idlib is an opposition stronghold one of the few large areas still under rebel control in the west of the country. Rebels and their families who have chosen to leave areas under regime siege around Damascus in evacuation deals have headed for Idlib. Source TRTWorld and agencies"

__label__0	"__topic__2 US-led airstrikes target ISIS stronghold Raqqa Published July 5 2015 U.S.-led coalition aircraft unleashed a series of airstrikes targeting the self proclaimed Islamic State (ISIS) groups stronghold of Raqqa in eastern Syria in what the coalition said Sunday was one of its most sustained aerial operations carried out in Syria to date. ISIS said at least 10 people were killed and many others wounded. At least 16 airstrikes were reported late Saturday and early Sunday triggering successive explosions that shook the city and created panic among residents activists said. The U.S.-led coalition often targets ISIS-held towns and cities in Syria but the overnight strikes on Raqqa were rare in their intensity. In a statement issued early Sunday the coalition said it had conducted 16 airstrikes throughout Raqqa destroying vital ISIS-controlled structures and transit routes in Syria. ""The significant airstrikes tonight were executed to deny Daesh the ability to move military capabilities throughout Syria and into Iraq"" said coalition spokesman Lt. Col. Thomas Gilleran using the Arabic acronym for the ISIS group. ""This was one of the largest deliberate engagements we have conducted to date in Syria and it will have debilitating effects on Daeshs ability to move"" from Raqqa he said. Raqqa is the de facto capital of the so-called caliphate declared a year ago by the ISIS terror group in territories it controls in Iraq and Syria. The sustained airstrikes add pressure on the militants in Raqqa still reeling from last months loss of the border town of Tal Abyad to Kurdish fighters. The town on the Turkish border was a major avenue for commerce and smuggling for the group. A militant website said 10 people were killed and dozens of others wounded. An ISIS-affiliated Facebook page said one civilian was among those killed and 10 were wounded including women and children. It also said the bombing destroyed several bridges. The ISIS-affiliated Aamaq news agency released a video of what it said was the effects of shelling Saturday by a U.S. drone on Raqqa. It showed several wounded men on a stretcher and at least three young boys being treated for wounds at what appeared to be a hospital. A Raqqa-based anti-ISIS activist network reported eight civilians were killed by the coalition airstrikes including a 10-year-old child. The casualty figures could not be independently confirmed. The network called Raqqa is Being Silently Slaughtered said at least one airstrike targeted a group of ISIS members in the city center. Another targeted an ISIS checkpoint while a third destroyed large parts of an ISIS-held brick factory in the city. In the remote northeastern city of Hassakeh ISIS suicide bombers detonated an explosives-laden truck near a main power plant Sunday. State-run news agency SANA reported casualties and damage in the plant on the southern edge of the city. Fighting has raged in Hassakeh since the ISIS group attacked several southern neighborhoods held by government troops earlier this month. The violence has forced tens of thousands of residents to flee. The predominantly Kurdish city was split between government forces and Kurdish fighters who have been fighting the ISIS group separately. In Iraq a Defense Ministry statement said government forces repelled an ISIS attack Sunday morning on the town of Haditha and the nearby Haditha dam in Anbar province. At least 20 militants were killed in the failed attack said the statement which did not provide any further information. Iraqi forces backed by Shiite militias have been struggling to recapture areas lost to the ISIS group in the countrys west and north. In May the militant group scored a stunning victory overrunning Ramadi the provincial capital of western Anbar province. Yet Haditha and some other towns remain under control of government forces and allied Sunni tribal fighters. In Lebanon some 200 Kurdish nationals staged a demonstration in downtown Beirut in solidarity with their brethren in Syria who are fighting against ISIS militants."

It was not immediately clear who carried out the raids that also hit several neighbourhoods in Idlib and wounded at least 90 people the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based monitor could not immediately confirm how many of the casualties were civilians saying some bodies ""were burned beyond recognition"". An AFP photographer in Idlib saw men clambering over rubble in just slippers or sandals to help evacuate wounded dust-covered residents and children from a collapsing building. Others tried to lift a bloodied shopper who had collapsed on the ground as a fire raged in a nearby open-air clothes market. A man his hand pressing a bloodied wound on his hand walked away clutching the hand of a barefooted boy. The raids also destroyed several shops and cars in the area. After marathon talks in Geneva US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said a ceasefire would begin Monday the first day of the Muslim feast of Eid al-Adha. If the deal is implemented Syrias armed forces would stop air strikes on rebel-held areas and desperately-needed aid would reach war-weary civilians. UN investigators last week said aerial bombardment by Syrian forces and their Russian ally namely in Idlib and Aleppo were causing huge civilian casualties and destroying vital infrastructure. Since spring 2015 most of Idlib province has been held by an alliance of rebels Islamists and jihadists known as the Army of Conquest. The Army of Conquest - led by the Fateh al-Sham Front which changed its name from Al-Nusra Front after renouncing ties with Al-Qaeda - is regularly bombarded by pro-government forces. More than 290000 people have been killed since Syrias conflict first erupted in March 2011 and several attempts at securing a long-lasting truce have faltered."

The bombardment came as a fresh round of peace talks to end Syrias six-year war entered a second day in the Kazakh capital Astana. Government fire on the besieged region has been on the rise for the past week with the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor saying the latest shelling hit a school in the town of Jisreen. ""A shell fired by regime troops hit the entrance of a school in Jisreen just as children were leaving it killing five people including four schoolchildren"" observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. A medical source at the town hospital confirmed the death toll and said another 25 people were wounded. An AFP photographer at the medical facility saw the bodies of four children wrapped in blood-stained white shrouds. Several wounded children lay or sat in shock on hospital beds including one with severed legs. A man cried out after learning his son had died as others around him tried to comfort him. Blood-stained satchels Small blue school bags and a tiny pair of shoes lay in a corner drenched in blood. Outside the primary school children stared at the pools of blood staining the concrete ground. ""I was coming out of school and was about to turn into a side street when the shell hit. There were dead people wounded people"" one child told AFP. The observatory said regime bombardment on Tuesday also hit other areas of Eastern Ghouta where opposition fighters have been battling President Bashar Assads troops for six years. The regime on July 22 announced a ceasefire with rebels in the besieged area which has been included in a so-called de-escalation zone agreed by Turkey Russia and Iran. On Tuesday regime shelling on the Mesraba area also in Eastern Ghouta killed three civilians including one child the observatory said. An AFP journalist at a morgue saw rescue volunteers and young men slip the bodies of a father and his son into white plastic bags. May God avenge oppressors the mans brother cried. In the town of Harasta shelling also hit near a school as pupils were leaving it wounding 10 people including five children. On Sunday 11 civilians including a journalist for pro-opposition television were killed in Eastern Ghouta. Malnutrition The shelling comes as Eastern Ghouta where an estimated 400000 people live faces a mounting humanitarian crisis. Shocking recent AFP images from the region showed severely underweight children and doctors reported two infants had died of malnutrition and related complications. On Monday dozens of trucks carrying aid for 40000 people entered Eastern Ghouta. The region was once a prime agricultural region famed for its orchards. But the rebel stronghold has been under a tight government siege since 2013 causing shortages of food and medicine as well as price hikes for the local and smuggled supplies available. Basic services are virtually non-existent with electricity produced only by generators and water often dirty and a vector for disease. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since the war began in March 2011 with anti-government protests. The conflict has since spiralled into a complex war involving world powers and the Daesh terror group extremists who took over large swathes of the country in 2014. But the extremists have since lost most of the territory they controlled and were ousted two weeks ago from their de facto Syrian capital of Raqqa. They face twin offensives in the eastern oil-rich province of Deir Ezzor from the regime and the US-backed Kurdish-Arab Syrian Democratic Forces."

Tags Syria Idlib Bashar al-Assad SOHR al-Qaeda al-Nusra Syrian rebels launched a huge offensive on government-held areas in north-western Syria in a bid to advance towards a coastal region vital to President Bashar al-Assads control of western Syria a monitoring group said on Tuesday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said insurgents including the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front captured government-held positions outside the town of Jisr al-Shughour and pushed into the northern tip of the Sahl al-Ghab plain overnight. Rami Abdulrahman who runs the UK-based Observatory said government forces had launched a counter attack and had recovered some lost ground in Sahl al-Ghab. Reuters reported a military source who said ""The battles are ongoing in that area between the army and the militant attackers the terrorists."" Insurgents including the Nusra Front captured Jisr al-Shughour in May part of a wider offensive that drove Syrian government forces from nearly all the northwestern province of Idlib. Rebels advance in western province after regime forces retreated Elsewhere Syrian troops and Kurdish fighters ousted the Islamic State group from Hasakeh Tuesday more than a month after the extremists launched an assault on the north-eastern city a monitoring group said. Government troops and Kurdish forces who share control of the city had been battling since June 25 to push IS forces out of the city which is the capital of Hasakeh province. IS ""was expelled by the army from Zuhur the last district in which it was present in Hasakeh and its fighters have been pushed to the southern outskirts of the city"" said Syrian Observatory for Human Rights director Rami Abdel Rahman. At least 287 IS fighters among them 26 minors had been killed in the fight for Hasakeh as well as strikes by the US-led coalition outside the city he said. Another 120 soldiers and pro-regime militiamen and several dozen Kurdish forces were also killed. State news agency SANA said Syrias armed forces ""dealt great blows to the Daesh (IS) terrorists in Zuhur"" Tuesday but did not say the extremists had been pushed out of the city. ""Army units advanced again into Zuhur where they executed a special operation against the terrorist hotbeds"" it reported. IS has attacked Hasakeh city several times but the latest assault was the most serious yet. Its forces initially seized several districts in the southern part of the city with Kurdish fighters and regime troops mobilising against them. The Observatory said IS had used at least 21 car bombs and several suicide bombers during the month-long campaign."

Tags Aleppo Syria toxic gas chlorine gas attack suffocation Russia At least four people were killed and many suffered breathing problems after a gas barrel was dropped over Aleppo on Wednesday. Those killed were believed to have inhaled chlorine gas and died from poisoning the manager of al-Quds hospital Hamza Khatib told Reuters news agency. At least 55 people were injured by the gas and Khatib had persevered evidence of the attack including patients clothing he told Reuters. Three deaths and 22 injuries were reported by the civil defence rescuers after barrels of gas believed to be chlorine were dropped on the Zubdiya neighbourhood in rebel-held Aleppo Reuters reported. A woman and a child died of suffocation after helicopters dropped explosive barrels on the neighbourhoods of Seif al-Dawla and Zubdiya the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Unconfirmed reports over the use of chlorine gas on rebel-held areas in eastern Aleppo emerged after the offensive on the city began in late June. Rebels and activists have reported barrel bombs containing poisonous gas were dropped on residential areas around Aleppo but the lack of chemical labs or independent testers made it difficult to verify these claims. A worlds chemical weapons watchdog raised concerns earlier this month over the reports of chlorine gas attacks around Aleppo. ""These reports are of great concern"" Ahmet Uzumcu the head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW] said in a statement. The UN-backed group based in The Hague ""continues to examine any credible reports"" of chemical weapons use the statement said. Uzumcu added that under international conventions the use of chemical weapons ""by anyone under any circumstances"" is seen ""as reprehensible and wholly contrary to the legal norms established by the international community.""

__label__0	__topic__2 Activists say more than 200 killed in gas attack near Damascus August 21 2013 Activists say more than 200 killed in gas attack near Damascus. Dominic Evans Khaled Yacoub Oweis. Syrian activists accused President Bashar al-Assads forces of launching a nerve gas attack that killed at least 213 people on Wednesday in what would if confirmed be by far the worst reported use of poison gas in the two-year-old civil war. Reuters was not able to verify the accounts independently and they were denied by Syrian state television which said they were disseminated deliberately to distract a team of United Nations chemical weapons experts which arrived three days ago. The U.N. team is in Syria investigating allegations that both rebels and army forces used poison gas in the past one of the main disputes in international diplomacy over Syria. Activists said rockets with chemical agents hit the Damascus suburbs of Ain Tarma Zamalka and Jobar before dawn. A nurse at Douma Emergency Collection facility Bayan Baker said the death toll as collated from medical centers in the suburbs east of Damascus was 213. Many of the casualties are women and children. They arrived with their pupil dilated cold limbs and foam in their mouths. The doctors say these are typical symptoms of nerve gas victims the nurse said. Extensive amateur video and photographs purporting to show victims appeared on the Internet. A video purportedly shot in the Kafr Batna neighborhood showed a room filled with more than 90 bodies many of them children and a few women and elderly men. Most of the bodies appeared ashen or pale but with no visible injuries. About a dozen were wrapped in blankets. Other footage showed doctors treating people in makeshift clinics. One video showed the bodies of a dozen people lying on the floor of a clinic with no visible wounds. The narrator in the video said they were all members of a single family. In a corridor outside lay another five bodies. A photograph taken by activists in Douma showed the bodies of at least 16 children and three adults one wearing combat fatigues laid at the floor of a room in a medical facility where bodies were collected. Syrian state television quoted a source as saying there was no truth whatsoever to the reports. Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas sarin and VX nerve agents. A youth affected by what activists say is nerve gas is treated at a hospital in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus August 21 2013. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh Assads officials have said they would never use poison gas - if they had it - against Syrians. The United States and European allies believe Assads forces used small amounts of sarin gas in attacks in the past which Washington called a red line that justified international military aid for the rebels. Assads government has responded in the past with accusations that it was the rebels that used chemical weapons which the rebels deny. Western countries say they do not believe the rebels have access to poison gas. Assads main global ally Moscow says accusations on both sides must be investigated. Khaled Omar of the opposition Local Council in Ain Tarma said he saw at least 80 bodies at the Hajjah Hospital in Ain Tarma and at a makeshift clinic at Tatbiqiya School in the nearby district of Saqba. Slideshow (3 Images) The attack took place at around 3:00 a.m. (0000 GMT / 8:00 p.m. Tuesday EDT). Most of those killed were in their homes Omar said. SURPRISING TIMING The timing and location of the reported chemical weapons use - just three days after the team of U.N. chemical experts checked in to a Damascus hotel a few km (miles) to the east at the start of their mission - was surprising. Logically it would make little sense for the Syrian government to employ chemical agents at such a time particularly given the relatively close proximity of the targeted towns (to the U.N. team) said Charles Lister analysts at IHS Janes Terrorism and Insurgency Center. Nonetheless the Ghouta region (where the attacks were reported) is well known for its opposition leanings. Jabhat al-Nusra has had a long-time presence there and the region has borne the brunt of sustained military pressure for months now he said referring to a hardline Sunni Islamist rebel group allied to al Qaeda. While it is clearly impossible to confirm the chemical weapons claim it is clear from videos uploaded by reliable accounts that a large number of people have died. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitoring group said dozens of people were killed including children in fierce bombardment. It said Mouadamiya southwest of the capital came under the heaviest attack since the start of the two-year conflict. The Observatory called on the U.N. experts and international organizations to visit the affected areas to ensure aid could be delivered and to launch an investigation to determine who was responsible for the bombardment and hold them to account.

The ISIS run Amaq news agency said that 160 civilians were killed in raids on the Manbij countryside whilst an international coalition source did not deny that airstrikes had been carried out in Manbij recently and said that an investigation into the matter is being carried out. The source told Asharq Al-Awsat that. We have seen the reports that indicate that people were killed as a result of the shelling and we are now collecting information on the matter from several parties some of which were close to the sites that were targeted. Based on the results we will take necessary measures. We would like to stress that we take precautions and measures to avoid targeting civilians and minimise the harm that may affect them. Meanwhile the US military announced in a statement that opposition fighters that are backed by the United States and are fighting ISIS militants in Syria took control of a base from which operations were led in the city of Manbij at the beginning of the week. The Director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP that the bombing carried out by the international coalition targeted the outskirts of the village of Tokhar at dawn yesterday which resulted in 56 civilians dying including 11 children. Other Syrian opposition websites stated that the death toll has risen to 85 people including five entire families most of which were women and children after residential areas were targeted. Opposition websites also stated that the bombing resulted in the destruction of a mill and a number of mosques and schools.

(AP Archive) A car bombing blamed on Daesh killed at least 26 displaced people in eastern Syria on Friday the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said. The war monitor said that 12 children were among the victims of the attack on a gathering at a checkpoint run by US-backed militants of the YPG-dominated-SDF in Deir Ezzor province where Daesh is losing ground to two separate offensives aimed at ousting it from Syria. ""Dozens of people were wounded and the death toll could rise because of the number of serious injuries"" said SHOR director Rami Abdel Rahman. The displaced people had been on their way to neighbouring Hasakeh province where camps have been set up to house them in YPG-controlled territory Abdel Rahman said. Daesh battling for survival Daesh controls roughly one quarter of oil-rich Deir Ezzor province but is battling for survival on two fronts. One offensive against it is by Syrian regime forces backed by Russian air power while the second is by YPG. Daesh group is now cornered in part of Deir Ezzor province around the border town of Abu Kamal on the frontier with Iraq and many civilians have been trying to flee the affected areas. The group seized large areas of both Syria and Iraq in a lightning 2014 campaign but has this year seen its self-proclaimed ""caliphate"" crumble as it came under multiple offensives.

The attack on the town of Khan Sheikhun killed at least 58 civilians and saw dozens suffering respiratory problems and symptoms including vomiting fainting and foaming at the mouth the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said. Syrias opposition blamed President Bashar Assads forces saying the attack cast doubt on the future of peace talks. The army denied any involvement however issuing a statement blaming ""terrorist groups"" for using ""chemical and toxic substances"". At least 11 children were among the dead the observatory said and an AFP correspondent in Khan Sheikhun saw many attached to respirators. If confirmed it would be one of the worst chemical attacks since the start of Syrias civil war six years ago. The incident brought swift international condemnation with the United States France and Britain all pointing the finger at Assad. US blames Damascus The White House condemned what it said was a ""reprehensible"" attack carried out by Assads forces. Spokesman Sean Spicer said President Donald Trump had been briefed extensively on the incident adding that the US was ""confident in its assessment"" that Damascus was to blame. Spicer also suggested it was in the ""best interest"" of Syrians for Assad not to lead the country. UN envoy Staffan de Mistura said the attack was believed to be chemical and launched from the air adding that there should be a ""clear identification of responsibilities and accountability"". The observatory said the attack on a residential part of Khan Sheikhun came early on Tuesday morning when a warplane carried out strikes that released ""toxic gas"". As well as those killed at least 160 people were injured it said and many were dying even after arriving at medical facilities. The monitor could not confirm the nature of the gas but said the attack was likely carried out by government warplanes. We heard strikes this morning... We ran inside the houses and saw whole families just dead in their beds. Children women old people dead in the streets resident Abu Mustafa said. Russias military which has been fighting in support of Assads government since September 2015 denied carrying out any strikes near the town. Hours after the initial attack air strikes also hit a hospital in the town where doctors were treating victims the AFP correspondent said bringing down rubble on top of medics as they worked. He saw a young girl a woman and two elderly people dead at a hospital. A father carried his dead little girl her lips blueish and her dark curls visible wrapped in a sheet. As doctors worked a warplane circled overhead striking first near the facility and then hitting it twice inflicting severe damage and prompting nearly a dozen medical staff to flee. Speaking to AFP medic Hazem Shehwan said victims were suffering from symptoms including pinpoint pupils convulsions foaming at the mouth and rapid pulses. Army denial Khan Sheikhun is in Idlib province which is largely controlled by an alliance of rebels including former Al Qaeda affiliate Fateh Al Sham Front. The province is regularly targeted in government and Russian air strikes and has also been hit by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh group usually targeting extremists. Syrias leading opposition group the National Coalition blamed Assad for the attack and demanded the UN open an immediate investigation and hold those responsible to account. Failure to do so will be understood as a message of blessing to the regime for its actions it said. Damascus officially joined the Chemical Weapons Convention and turned over its declared chemical arsenal in 2013 as part of a deal to avert US military action. That agreement came after hundreds of people up to 1429 according to a US intelligence report were killed in chemical weapons strikes allegedly carried out by government troops east and southwest of Damascus. But there have been repeated allegations of chemical weapons use since with a UN-led investigation pointing the finger at the regime for at least three chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. The army again denied using chemical weapons on Tuesday insisting it has never used them any time anywhere and will not do so in the future. The global chemical arms watchdog said it was seriously concerned by reports of the attack. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it was gathering and analysing information from all available sources. The UNs Commission of Inquiry for Syria said it had begun investigating the alleged use of chemical weapons. Peace talks doubts More than 320000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests. Successive rounds of peace talks including a UN-sponsored meeting in Geneva last week have failed to produce a political breakthrough. Tuesdays attack cast new doubt on the peace process said the oppositions chief negotiator Mohamad Sabra. If the United Nations cannot deter the regime from carrying out such crimes how can it achieve a process that leads to political transition in Syria? he told AFP. A senior Syrian security source told AFP that opposition forces were trying to achieve in the media what they could not achieve on the ground by spreading images from the alleged attack site. The UN Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the attack following calls from France and Britain. Ive seen the reports about the use of sarin and as far as I know they have not been confirmed the British ambassador to the UN Matthew Rycroft said. This is clearly a war crime Rycroft told reporters. I call on the Security Council members who have previously used their vetoes to defend the indefensible to change their course."

__label__1	__topic__2 Syria: have the Chemical Weapons gloves come off? Friday 23 August 2013 Syria: have the Chemical Weapons gloves come off? As the international community tries to wrap its head around the recent allegations of chemical weapons attack in Syria numerous unanswered questions remain on the type of agent used and the party who carried it leaving the door open on the repercussions of such an attack on the diplomatic and military levels. News of the Ghoutta Massacre have surfaced on Wednesday with the opposition accusing the Syrian government of launching a Chemical attack and killing between 1000 and 1800 people. Understanding the attack Based on videos of responders that surfaced after the attack and the nature of casualties Gwyn Winfield editor of CBRNe World a publication that specializes in unconventional weapons tells Al-Arabiya that they suggest that it might be chemical biological or radiological device. The symptoms which included shortage of breath pinpoint pupils mucus secretions that it was a chemical attack but exactly which chemical it is is difficult to decide says the expert. Verifying the kind of agent used and getting specifics on the attack would require according to Winfield a sample of the agent itself or a blood or hair sample from a victim or casualty. The least value evidence would be water or soil from the area where the rockets landed. While lot of fingers have been pinpointed in different directions after the attack with the Assad regime denying the attack altogether and the opposition implicating the government three indications are mandatory to know in order to identify the source says Winfield. They are: the agent itself the delivery system (rocket/shell/mortar and the device that fires it) and the skill needed to bring the three together (personnel). The most difficult part in this is identifying the agent as Syria has the delivery system and skill in abundance. Winfield notes that the Assad regime has stated that they have a close hold on the agent a statement that is designed to assure Western powers as much as allies that the regime has control over these weapons. But the risk of the regime losing control over such material has long been a concern of Washington and neighbors of Syria. Winfield says that all the rebels would need is overrun an ammunition dump with a small supply of agent to stage such an attack. Repercussions The concern in Washington and in many Western capitals is that regardless of who staged the attack the turn of events towards chemical weapons use in Syria or these weapons falling in the wrong hands is a red line and a major security threat. Andrew Tabler a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy tells Al-Arabiya that if the chemical weapons use is confirmed on such a massive scale it will be much harder for the Barack Obama administration not to respond warning that this might be a sign of more systematic use in the future if we are not there already. The Wall Street Journal quoting Pentagon officials said yesterday that the U.S. began refining its military options for possible strikes in Syria. In a parallel effort Secretary of State John Kerry is working the diplomatic track and has placed calls to his French Russian and Turkish counterparts to discuss potential response. Obama told CNN today that core national interests are now at stake if Chemical weapons use is verified both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating as well as needing to protect our allies our bases in the region. Tabler does not expect an immediate military action however due to the time needed to plan militarily and for diplomacy and coalition building a priority for the Obama administration. Still he warns that Washington can not afford waiting too long. But even military action in the form of airstrikes would not resolve the Chemicals weapons threat. Winfield points out that it is very difficult to protect these weapons and the chances of killing everyone that knows how to operate these systems is slim as is the chance of destroying every mortar howitzer and rocket battery. He says that destroying a chemical agent is very difficult to do safely and it would require special forces on the ground something that the U.S. has been very reluctant about doing in Syria.

A man walks by a damaged site after bomb blasts claimed by DAESH hit the northeastern Syrian city of Qamishli near the Turkish border. July 27 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) A bomb blast in the Syrian city of Qamishli on Wednesday killed 48 people and left dozens more wounded. The attack is believed to be among the deadliest in the city for years the British-based Syrian Obervatory for Human Rights said. A large truck bomb was set off near the security headquarters of the Kurdish administration that controls most of Hasaka province in the northeast said the Observatory. The death toll is expected to rise because of the number of people seriously injured added the Observatory. The official SANA news agency said at least 140 people were injured. The attack was initially believed to be a double bombing but sources in the city and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights subsequently said the initial attack caused a gas tank to detonate. My god! Look at the devastation from this terrorist attack in Qamishli. My prayers are with the victims. pic.twitter.comezhmZ1GOG4 Leith Abou Fadel (leithfadel) July 27 2016 State TV rolled footage from the scene of the blast showing large-scale damage to buildings vast amounts of rubble strewn across the road with plumes of smoke rising. The explosion was so powerful that it shattered windows in shops in the nearby Turkish town of Nusaybin which is directly across the border from where the blast occurred. Two people were slightly hurt in Nusaybin a witness said. The attack was claimed by DAESH. The assault against DAESH in the city of Manbij near the Turkish border has put it under pressure cutting off all routes out of the city. Fighters from the US-backed alliance have recently made incremental advances as they try to flush out the remaining DAESH fighters in Manbij. DAESH has previously targeted Qamishli and the provincial capital Hasaka city with bombs. A suicide blast killed six members of the Kurdish internal security force known as the Asayish in April. In July a suicide bomb killed at least 16 people in Hasaka. Kurdish forces control much of Hasaka province after capturing vast areas from the DAESH in 2015. Source TRTWorld and agencies

(AFP Photo) At least 16 civilians including women and children were killed Friday during an air raid by the Syrian regime army on the opposition-held neighborhood of Tareeq al-Bab in Aleppo Syrias largest city according to a pro-opposition civil defense source on the ground. The missiles fired from a Syrian warplane also wounded 25 others Ibrahim Abu Leys told Anadolu Agency.

Since then more than a quarter of a million people have been killed - and more than 10 million displaced - throughout the war-battered country according to the UN.

Air strikes pounded neighbourhoods around a childrens hospital and a blood bank in rebel-held eastern Aleppo on Wednesday in a second day of renewed bombing that has killed at least 32 people a war monitor medics and emergency workers said. Russian military planes were seen all night until morning in several regions of Idlib in northwestern Syria said Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The regime air force bombed eastern sectors of Aleppo Syrias divided second city Abdel Rahman told AFP. The air raids formed part of a wider military escalation by the Syrian government and allies including Russia which fired coordinated volleys of missiles at rebels on Tuesday and for the first time used its only aircraft carrier. The Syrian Observatory said the air strikes on eastern Aleppo on Wednesday alone killed at least 21 people including five children and an emergency worker. They were carried out by either Russian or Syrian warplanes it said. The Observatory said districts struck included al-Shaar al-Sukkari al-Sakhour and Karam al-Beik. Air raids also continued in the countryside west of Aleppo from which rebels have launched assaults on government-held areas. An attack on the village of Batbo killed at least 19 people including three children the Observatory said. Moscow has denied reports that its jets have hit Aleppo in the renewed wave of bombardment and said it was sticking to a moratorium on air strikes in the city. Tuesdays bombing run on eastern Aleppo appeared to mark the end of a pause inside the city declared by Russia on Oct. 18 which Syrias military had also largely observed. The Observatory and residents said the citys east was hit by rocket fired from jets barrel bombs dropped from helicopters and artillery from government forces. The helicopters wont stop for a single moment Bebars Mishal a civil defence worker in rebel-held Aleppo told Reuters. Right now the bombing wont let up. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu spoke of a major operation which saw the first missions carried out by warplanes taking off from the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier that arrived off Syria last week. The Kremlin said on Wednesday that a moratorium on Russian air strikes against targets in Aleppo remained in place for the time being. In this Oct. 11 2016 file photo provided by the Syrian Civil Defense group known as the White Helmets residents sit amongst rubble in rebel-held eastern Aleppo Syria. (AP) The offensive drew strong condemnation from the United States which said it had received reports of hospitals and clinics being bombed. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo has been ravaged by the war that has killed more than 300000 people across the country since it started in March 2011 with anti-government protests. UN condemns Syrian attacks in Aleppo Meanwhile a UN committee has approved a resolution strongly condemning the recent escalation of attacks in Aleppo and continuing violence by the Syrian government against its own people. The General Assemblys human rights committee voted 116-15 with 49 abstentions in favor of the draft resolution on Tuesday. It is virtually certain to be adopted when the assembly votes next month. An injured child waits after receiving treatment at the University hospital in a government-held neighbourhood on November 3 2016 following reported rebel fire on government-held parts of the northern city of Aleppo. (AFP) The draft resolution demands that Syrian authorities immediately put an end to all indiscriminate attacks including those involving the use of terror tactics air strikes barrel and vacuum bombs incendiary weapons chemical weapons and heavy artillery. It deplores and condemns in the strongest terms widespread human rights violations by the Syrian government. The draft calls for a cease-fire by all parties saying this is essential to achieve a political solution. Food production in Syria at all-time low Food production has dropped to an all-time low in Syria where civilians are struggling through their sixth winter in a war zone UN agencies said on Tuesday. Many farmers have had to abandon their land unable to afford the soaring cost of seeds fertilizers and tractor fuel the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme said. Wheat output - vital for making flat loaves of bread a staple of the Syrian diet - dropped from an average 3.4 million metric tonnes harvested before the war began in 2011 to 1.5 million this year they said in a joint statement. Play Video The area planted for cereals in the 2015-16 cropping season is the smallest ever they added citing field visits and surveys that also showed record low production of barley. Food production in Syria has hit a record low due to fighting and insecurity but also weather conditions World Food Programme spokeswoman Bettina Luescher told a news briefing in Geneva. Food shortages are particularly worrying in east Aleppo the rebel-held part of the city besieged by government forces where the UN says 250000-275000 civilians still live. The last food rations provided by the UN have been given out (in east Aleppo). It is very hard to say how people will be coping there. Of course it is a very different situation in the capital where food is available at the markets and people can buy things Luescher said. Before the war Syria was an exporter of livestock. Now herds and flocks have shrunk there are 30 percent fewer cattle 40 percent fewer sheep and goats and a staggering 60 percent less poultry which of course is the most affordable source of animal protein Luescher said. More than 7 million people in Syria are classified as food insecure meaning they are not always sure where their next meal is coming from she added. The World Food Programme is distributing rations to more than 4 million people in Syria each month. (With AP Reuters and AFP) Last Update: Wednesday 16 November 2016 KSA 20:36 - GMT 17:36 12480

Syrian rescue workers of the Civil Defence said that they had taken away at least 100 bodies from the site of Saturdays blast which hit buses carrying Shiite residents as they waited to cross from rebel into government territory in an evacuation deal between the warring sides. The British-based Observatory said the number was expected to rise. Those killed were mostly residents of the villages of al-Foua and Kefraya in Idlib province but included rebel fighters guarding the convoy the Observatory said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack which pro-Damascus media said was carried out by a suicide car bomber. Syrias main armed opposition condemned the bombing with groups fighting under the banner of the Free Syrian Army describing it as a ""treacherous terrorist attack"". Pope Francis in an Easter message also condemned the attack describing it as ""ignoble"" and asking God to bring healing and comfort to what he called the ""beloved and martyred Syria"". The convoy was carrying at least 5000 people including civilians and several hundred pro-government fighters who were granted safe passage out of the two Shiite villages which are besieged by rebels. Under the evacuation deal more than 2000 people including rebel fighters were granted safe passage out of Madaya a town near Damascus besieged by government forces and their allies. That convoy was waiting at a bus garage in a government-held area on Aleppos outskirts a few miles from where the attack took place. Madaya evacuees said they heard the blast."

__label__1	__topic__2 Syrian air strikes on ISIL-controlled Raqqa kills 19 Sun Aug 17 2014 Syrian air strikes on ISIL-controlled Raqqa kills 19. Syrian air force bombers have pounded a major stronghold of the ISIL terrorist group in northern Syiran town of Raqqa reportedly killing at least 19 terrorists on the ground. Reporting the bombing of areas occupied by the Takfiri terrorist group on Sunday the opposition-linked Syrian Observatory for Human Rights further said the Syrian warplanes conducted more than a dozen airstrikes against ISIL position in the town over the past 24 hours. Director of the UK-based Observatory Rami Abdurrahman also stated that six of the Syrian air raids targeted Raqqas military court. He added that at least 16 Takfiri terrorists were killed in the town and around 40 wounded. Other reports from opposition sources in the area offered different accounts on the casualty figures. Opposition-linked groups inside Syria further reported government airstrikes on ISIL-controlled areas in Aleppo province as well including the towns of Akhtarin and Dabiq. The latest developments come as Syrian army has achieved major victories in its battle against Takfiri groups across the country over the past months. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad says the Takfiri war in his country has strongly shifted in favor of government forces as they have made continuous gains in their fight against the terrorists. Syria has been gripped by deadly violence since March 2011. An estimated 170000 people have reportedly been killed and millions displaced due to the violence fueled by the Western-backed militants. The West and its regional allies including Qatar Saudi Arabia and Turkey are giving financial and military support to the militants. MBMB

Quoting reports from its local partners in Syria UNICEF said health workers were reported to have pulled bodies of children from under rubble in the town of al-Quria in Deir ez-Zor province which is mostly under DAESH control. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group reported on Saturday that air strikes carried out by Syrian or Russian warplanes killed dozens of people in al-Quria. Deir ez-Zor province links DAESHs de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa with territory it controls in Iraq. ""Three attacks reportedly hit heavily crowded areas including a mosque during prayer time"" UNICEF said in a statement. ""UNICEF deplores these attacks and calls on all parties to the conflict to keep children out of harms way."" On Sunday a monitor said at least 82 people including 58 civilians were killed during airstrikes launched by Russia and Bashar Assads regime on the DAESH-held area of eastern Syria. ""Three Russian and Syrian regime air raids on the region of Al-Quriyah southeast of Deir ez-Zor city killed 58 civilians"" the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. It added that 24 other people were killed without specifying whether they were civilians or DAESH extremists. DAESH holds around 60 percent of Deir e-Zzor the capital of the province of the same name which is next to the extremist-held Raqqa province. Last week the Syrian opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC) called on U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to launch an investigation into their assertions that Russia has repeatedly used air-delivered incendiary weapons against civilians in Syria. ""Russian air forces have repeatedly deployed incendiary weapons and cluster munitions to kill main and terrorize Syrian civilians including in at least 10 documented incidents"" Riad Hijab coordinator of the opposition HNC wrote to Ban. ""They have violated the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons and breached international humanitarian law"" he wrote. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests which erupted as part of the Arab Spring uprisings with unexpected ferocity and disproportionate force. Russia first began its air campaign in Syria on Sept. 30 of last year. While Russia claims its campaign is aimed primarily at the DAESH terrorist group it has repeatedly targeted civilian areas and the moderate anti-regime opposition groups that control them. Since then more than a quarter of a million people have been killed and more than 10 million displaced throughout the war-battered country according to the U.N. The Syrian Center for Policy Research a nongovernmental organization however has put the death toll from the five-year conflict at as high as 470000. Watchdog Thousands tortured to death by Syrian regime Meanwhile a human rights group said more than 12000 people have been tortured to death by the Syrian regime since 2011. In a Sunday statement the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) said that 12679 people died of torture from March 2011 to June 2016. ""The Syrian regime is responsible for 99 percent of deaths due to torture at detention centers"" the statement added which was issued to mark the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture. SNHR Director Fadl Abdel-Ghani said his group could not document any case of detention with a legal warrant. ""The regime has committed crimes against humanity"" he said citing sexual assault killing and involuntary disappearance as some of the practices by the Syrian regime. Last month The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said that at least 60000 people have died in Syrian government jails during the five-year conflict. He said more than 20000 of them had died at Sednaya prison near Damascus. The observatory said it had been able to verify the deaths of 14456 people 110 of them under the age of 18 since the start of the Syrian uprising in 2011. ""We know large numbers of people have died in detention in Syria"" said Nadim Houry deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch in a telephone interview. A Syrian defector known as Caesar in 2013 smuggled out tens of thousands of photos taken between May 2011 and August 2013 that show at least 6786 separate individuals who had died in government custody HRW said in a report issued in December. That toll was calculated by the Syrian Association for Missing and Conscience Detainees (SAFMCD) which was formed by an opposition body and reviewed all the photos the HRW report said. U.N. investigators said in February the reported killings of detainees amounting to a state policy of ""extermination"" of the civilian population a crime against humanity."

Tags Aleppo siege Syria Islamic State Syrian Democratic Forces At least 10 people including seven children were killed in airstrikes on the rebel-held east of Aleppo city on Friday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. The Britain-based group said it was unclear if the raids on Aleppos Marjeh district were carried out by aircraft belonging to the Syrian government or its ally Russia. The latest civilian deaths come as the rebels press on with an assault intended to break a government siege of opposition-held Aleppo that began on July 17 and has raised fears of a humanitarian crisis. The assault started on Sunday and is targeting the Ramussa district that contains the main supply route to the government-held west of the city. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo has been ravaged by the war that began in March 2011 with anti-government protests. After some initial advances government forces backed by Russian airstrikes have pushed back opposition fighters which include extremists from al-Qaedas former Syrian affiliate. According to the Observatory at least 112 civilians including 33 children have been killed in Aleppo since the rebel assault began on Sunday. The deaths include 65 people among them 22 children killed in rebel fire on government neighbourhoods the Observatory said. Another 42 people including 11 children have been killed in strikes on eastern Aleppo the monitor said. It reported five more deaths in rebel fire on the Kurdish-majority Sheikh Maqsud district of the city. Elsewhere in the Aleppo province the monitor said an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters were advancing inside the Islamic State [IS] bastion of Manbij. Observatory chief Rami Abdul Rahman said the Syrian Democratic Forces [SDF] now held 70 percent of the town. ""The Islamic State has entered its final phase in the town of Manbij"" he told AFP adding however that IS was keeping a number of civilians there as human shields. ""The progress the SDF has made in the last week is more than it was able to achieve in previous weeks put together."" The SDF began an assault on Manbij in late May and entered the town on June 23 with support from the US-led coalition against IS. Manbij sits on the route between the Turkish border and the eastern city of Raqqa the extremists de facto capital in Syria. Read Also"

A family of 6 persons has been able to get out of Aleppo eastern countryside on Sunday. They were received by Aleppo governor at al-Baath partys building in the city. The situation in the eastern neighborhoods is very difficult due to the crimes of armed terrorist organizations which prevent civilians from leaving the area and perpetrate the most ugliest crimes against the citizens Mohammad Idelbi father of the family told SANA reporter. Aleppo Governor for his part affirmed that all demands of the family of the basic materials for living and shelter were provided for them. Earlier two families of ten members managed to leave the eastern neighborhoods of Aleppo city where they were welcomed by Aleppo Governor Hussein Diab and Secretary of Aleppo Brach of the al- Baath Arab Socialist Party Ahmad Saleh Ibrahim. Mohammad Ali al-Hassan his wife and three children in addition to Abdul Azeem Sammaqiyeh his wife and three children managed to cross and reach safe areas according to SANA. Al-Hassan told SANA reporter that they tried more than once to exit but every time the terrorists groups prevent them by the force of weapon adding that today he and his family were able to leave through Hanano area. He noted that the terrorist groups are preventing the locals from getting food and medicines as they have exclusive access to these materials. In turn Sammaqiyeh talked about the critical situation of the families in the eastern parts of Aleppo city due to terrorism and terrorist atrocities indicating that they ( families) are waiting for the Syrian Arab Army to save them and liberate their areas. He said that if the locals were able to leave not a single family would stay in those areas. Governor Diab indicated to the governorates efforts to welcome families who leave the eastern neighborhoods and provide them with their food service and health needs. For the second day hundreds of families continued their protests against the takfiri terrorist organizations demanding them to immediately get out of the residential areas. Earlier the Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said that the gunmen suppressed protests in which more than 1500 people took part in the neighborhoods of Bustan al-Qasr al-Kallaseh al-Ameriyeh and al-Fardous adding that the terrorists have trapped all streets leading to the humanitarian routes in addition to killing 27 civilians and injuring hundreds of others while dispersing the protesters.

__label__1	"__topic__2 Dozens of civilians dead in rebel assault on Aleppo Dozens of civilians dead in rebel assault on Aleppo AFP Sunday 30 Oct 2016 Syrias regime and rebels were locked in fierce fighting Sunday on Aleppos western edges where 38 civilians have been killed in a two-day opposition offensive to break the government siege. Rebels and allied militants launched a major offensive on Friday to break through government lines and reach the 250000 people living in the citys east. Since then they have unleashed a salvo of rockets artillery shells and car bombs around the western government-controlled districts. Syrias second city Aleppo has been devastated by some of the heaviest fighting of the countrys five-year civil war which has killed more than 300000 people. Much of the once-bustling economic hub has been reduced to rubble by air and artillery bombardment including barrel bombs - crude unguided explosive devices that cause indiscriminate damage. ""Rebel fighters have launched hundreds of rockets and shells onto the western districts from positions inside the city and on its western edges"" said Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Two days of such heavy rebel bombardment have killed 38 civilians including 14 children and wounded another 250. Fighting has also killed 30 regime and allied fighters as well as 50 Syrian rebels according to the Observatory. The monitor did not have an immediate death toll for foreign anti-regime fighters many of whom have joined the militants factions. About 1500 rebels have massed on a 15-kilometre front along the western edges of Aleppo since Friday scoring quick gains in the Dahiyet al-Assad district but struggling to push east since then. ""The advance will be from Dahiyet al-Assad towards Hamdaniyeh"" said Yasser al-Youssef of the Noureddin al-Zinki rebel faction. Hamdaniyeh is a regime-held district directly adjacent to opposition-controlled eastern neighbourhoods. Fighting lasted all night and into Sunday with air strikes and artillery fire along the western battlefronts heard even in the eastern districts an AFP correspondent there said. Plumes of smoke could be seen snaking up from the citys skyline. A pro-regime military source told AFP that the rebel assault was ""massive and coordinated"" but insisted it was unable to break into any neighbourhoods besides Dahiyet al-Assad. ""Theyre using Grad missiles and car bombs and are supported by foreign fighters in their ranks"" he said. Those waging the assault include Aleppo rebels and reinforcements from Idlib province to the west among them the militant Fateh al-Sham Front which changed its name from Al-Nusra Front after breaking ties with Al-Qaeda. Aleppos front line runs through the heart of the city dividing rebels in the east from government troops in the west. In late September government troops launched their own assault to recapture all of the eastern rebel-controlled territory. It was backed by fierce air strikes from Russia which launched its own air war in 2015 to back President Bashar al-Assads forces. That onslaught spurred massive international criticism of both Moscow and Damascus. Last week Russia implemented a three-day ""humanitarian pause"" intended to allow civilians and surrendering rebels to leave Aleppos east but few did so. Moscow says it will continue a halt on air strikes over Aleppo in place since October 18. The Russian military said Friday it had asked President Vladimir Putin for authorization to resume the raids. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin ""considers it inappropriate at the current moment"" adding that the president thought it necessary to ""continue the humanitarian pause"" in Aleppo."

Many residents of Fuaa and Kafraya lost their lives after terrorists attacked their buses. Afp - The death toll in a suicide car bomb attack on buses carrying Syrians evacuated from two besieged government-held towns has risen to at least 112 a monitoring group said Sunday. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that 98 evacuees from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya were killed when an explosives-laden vehicle hit their buses at a transit point west of Aleppo on Saturday. It said the remainder of the dead were aid workers and rebels tasked with guarding the buses. It warned the death toll may rise further as ""hundreds"" more were wounded in the blast. Dozens of buses carrying several thousand refugees had been stuck by the roadside in the rebel-held town of Rashidin after leaving Fuaa and Kafraya on Friday under a deal reached between the government and opposition groups. More than 30000 people are set for evacuation under the deal brokered by rebel backer Qatar and regime ally Iran. Fuaa and Kafraya have been under rebel siege for more than two years. As part of the deal several hundred people including armed rebels will be transported out of Madaya and Zabadani towns near Damascus which are surrounded by pro-government forces. Syrias six-year civil war has seen several similar deals which the government of President Bashar al-Assad says are the best way to end the violence. Rebels say they are being forced to relocate through bombardment and seige. The government blamed Saturdays attack on ""terrorists."" The blast puts the four-town evacuation deal brokered partly by rebel backer Qatar and government ally Iran in doubt. The Observatory said after the bombing that the evacuation process had resumed but it was not immediately clear on Sunday if convoys had restarted their journeys."

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group put the death toll at 58 saying there were 11 children among the dead. Meanwhile the Idlib Media Center said dozens of people had been killed. There was no comment from the regime in Damascus or any international agency in the immediate aftermath of the attack. A Syrian regime source denied that the regime had used any such weapons saying the army does not and has not used chemical weapons not in the past and not in the future. It deemed such claims as rebel propaganda. It was the third claim of a chemical attack in just over a week in Syria. The previous two were reported in Hama province in an area not far from Khan Sheikhoun the site of Tuesdays alleged attack. The Syrian American Medical Society which supports hospitals in opposition-held territory said it had sent a team of inspectors to Khan Sheikhoun before noon and an investigation was underway. The Syrian activists had no information on what agent could have been used in the assault. They claimed the attack was caused by an airstrike carried out either by the regime or Russian warplanes. A Turkey-based Syrian woman whose niece husband and one-year-old daughter were among those killed said the warplanes struck early as residents were still in their beds she said speaking on condition of anonymity because she feared for the safety of family members back in Syria. Makeshift hospitals soon crowded with people suffocating. The province of Idlib is almost entirely controlled by the Syrian opposition. It is home to some 900000 displaced Syrians according to the United Nations. Rebels and opposition officials have expressed concerns that the regime is planning to mount a concentrated attack on the crowded province. Tuesdays reports came on the eve of a major international meeting in Brussels on the future of Syria and the region hosted by the EUs High Representative Federica Mogherini. Claims of chemical weapons attacks particularly the use of the chlorine agent are not uncommon in Syrias conflict. The worst attack was what a UN report said was an attack by toxic sarin gas in August 2013 on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta that killed hundreds of civilians. The Syrian Coalition an opposition group based outside the country said regime planes carried out the airstrike on Khan Sheikhoun south of the city of Idlib the provincial capital. It said the planes fired missiles carrying poisonous gases killing dozens of people many of them women and children. The coalition described the attack as a horrifying massacre. Photos and video emerging from Khan Sheikhoun show limp bodies of children and adults. Some are seen struggling to breathe; others appear foaming at the mouth. A medical doctor going by the name of Dr. Shajul Islam for fears for his own safety said his hospital in Idlib province received three victims all with narrow pinpoint pupils that did not respond to light. He published video of the patients on his Twitter account. Pinpoint pupils breathing difficulties and foaming at the mouth are symptoms commonly associated with toxic gas exposure. The oppositions Civil Defense search-and-rescue group which released photos showing paramedics washing down victims has not published a casualty toll. The activist-run Assi Press published video of paramedics carrying victims from the scene by a pickup truck. The victims were stripped down to their underwear. Many appeared unresponsive. Warplanes continued to pound the town after the attack including near a medical point where victims were being treated the Observatory said. Most of the towns streets had become empty a witness said. The New York-based Human Rights Watch has accused the Syrian regime of conducting at least eight chemical attacks using chlorine gas on opposition-controlled residential areas during the final months in the battle for Aleppo last year that killed at least nine civilians and injured 200. Also a joint investigation by the United Nations and the international chemical weapons watchdog determined the regime was behind at least three attacks in 2014 and 2015 involving chlorine gas and the ISIS group was responsible for at least one involving mustard gas.

The monitoring group updated its earlier death toll of 15 for the strike on Urum al-Joz saying three more people had died of serious injuries. It said the strike was believed to have been carried out by Russian planes which operate in support of the Assad regime. The Observatory which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. Idlib province is controlled by an opposition alliance and is regularly targeted by both the Assad regime and its Russian ally. Earlier this week a chemical attack hit the town of Khan Sheikhun in Idlib killing at least 87 civilians including 31 children. The Khan Sheikhun strike prompted Washington to take its first direct military action against Assad regime with missile strikes against a central air base on Friday morning.

People inspect the damage at a market in Syria hit by air strikes on June 5 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said air stikes thought to be carried out by Syrian and Russian forces killed at least 17 people including 8 children in a market in the Syrian city of Ashara near the southeast provincial capital Deir al-Zor city on Monday. According to the British-based human rights organisation it is feared the death toll will rise because of the high number of serious injuries. The Syrian regime which has been supported by Russia in aerial strikes across the country since September 2015 began attacking DAESH last week. But the Russian Defence Ministry has denied its warplanes carried out air strikes on the market place. Many civilians who are unable to move in and out of DAESH-held areas face the risk of being killed by constant air strikes. People salvage goods from an aid convoy that was damaged during an air strike in the opposition held area of al-Sakhour district of Aleppo. (TRT World and Agencies) UN says such offensives are successful in making gains on DAESH. They also put millions of people at risk of displacement. The UNS Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said last week that 20000 people have already been displaced as a result of the Kurdish-led offensive in Eastern Aleppos Abu Qalqal and Menbij city sub-districts which are mostly under the control of DAESH. According to Syrian government sources the army captured crossroads to advance to Raqqa in eastern Aleppo and the strategic city Deir al Zour which connects the territory to Iraq. The recent attack which killed civilians in the DAESH controlled territory came shortly after another strike by regime forces. At least 15 civilians were killed in air strikes on Friday in the DAESH-held area of Boulil near Deir al Zour. Men walk near a damaged building in Aleppos opposition held al-Fardous district Syria May 26 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) More than 500 casualties in Aleppo The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said on Monday that ""hysterical bombing"" continues in another neighbouring city of Aleppo also on the forty-fifth consecutive day. At least 502 civilian citizens have been killed and 2600 civilians citizens injured in regime and Russian bombings that caused great destruction in public facilities and hospitals said the Observatory. Among those killed were 105 children and 76 women over the age of eighteen.

__label__0	__topic__2 Massive Daesh bomb attack kills 44 in Syrian Kurdish city | Jordan Times Last updated at Jul 282016 QAMISHLI Syria A massive bomb blast claimed by the Daesh terror group killed at least 44 people and wounded dozens on Wednesday in the Kurdish-majority Syrian city of Qamishli. It was the largest and deadliest attack to hit the city since the beginning of Syrias conflict in March 2011. Syrian state media gave a toll of 44 dead and 140 injured in the bombing which hit a western district of the city where several local Kurdish ministries are located. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor gave a toll of 48 dead adding that children and women were among those killed. Kurdish officials said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber driving an explosives-laden truck adding that the blast detonated a nearby fuel container. An AFP journalist saw devastating scenes in the bombs aftermath with distraught civilians some covered in blood staggering through rubble past twisted metal and the burned-out remains of cars. One man running along the streets was completely covered in blood his shirt drenched red. He was gripping the arm of a small boy whose face was grey and red with blood and dust. They ran past a hysterical woman who was crying and screaming her clothes torn. A girl and boy stood next to her apparently in shock. Children could be heard screaming as smoke rose from small fires that continued to burn amongst the rubble. Civilians and local security forces with guns slung across their backs worked to carry the dead and wounded from the remains of damaged and destroyed buildings. US probes civilian casualties Daesh claimed the attack in a statement circulated on social media calling it a response to the crimes committed by the crusader coalition aircraft in the town of Manbij a bastion of the extremist group in Syrias Aleppo province. Kurdish fighters have been a key force battling the extremists in north and northeastern Syria and are the main component in the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance currently seeking to oust Daesh from Manbij. They are backed by air strikes launched by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh in Syria and Iraq. A spokesman for the coalition said on Wednesday it had opened a formal investigation to determine whether its strikes near Manbij last week had killed civilians. The observatory reported that 56 civilians were killed in strikes as they fled a village near Manbij on July 19 and Colonel Chris Garver said there was sufficient credible evidence of civilian victims to warrant a probe. Qamishli is under the shared control of the Syrian regime and Kurdish authorities who have declared zones of autonomous administration across parts of north and northeast Syria. It has regularly been targeted in bomb attacks many of which have been claimed by Daesh. But a source in the Kurdish Asayesh security forces told AFP that this is the largest explosion the city has ever seen. The area that was targeted houses several Kurdish administration buildings including the defence ministry and was considered a secure zone with multiple checkpoints and security measures in place. This blast is the biggest in Qamishli in terms of both the toll and the damage since the beginning of the war observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. Local officials said hospitals in the city had been swamped with casualties from the attack. And Syrian state television carried an appeal from the governor of Hasakeh province where Qamishli is located urging residents to go to public and private hospitals to donate blood for the victims of the terrorist bombings. More than 280000 people have been killed in Syria since the war began with anti-government protests that were met with a regime crackdown. In Aleppo city at least 18 people were killed in government air strikes and artillery fire on Wednesday on rebel-held neighbourhoods in the east of the city the observatory said. The Syrian army meanwhile officially announced it had severed all the supply routes and crossings used by terrorists to bring mercenaries weapons and ammunition into eastern neighbourhoods of Aleppo. The opposition-held east has been effectively under siege since July 7 when government forces advanced within firing range of the sole remaining route in. Aleppo was once the countrys economic powerhouse but it has been ravaged by war and divided roughly between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012.

__label__0	"__topic__2 Syria bombs jihadist positions in Raqa for second day Syria bombs jihadist positions in Raqa for second day AFP Monday 18 Aug 2014 Syrian war planes bombed positions belonging to the jihadist Islamic State group in the northern province of Raqa for a second day on Monday a monitoring group said. On Sunday regime planes killed 31 jihadists and eight civilians in an unprecedented wave of aerial bombardment against the group in its Raqa bastion. The bombing continued on Monday according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights with at least 14 raids against jihadist positions. There was no immediate death toll in the renewed bombing. Three raids targeted the area around the town of Tabqa in western Raqa and four hit near the Tabqa military airport the only remaining regime-held position in the province. The other seven strikes hit sites inside Raqa city the provincial capital. The raids involved the use of precision weapons rather than the explosive-packed barrel bombs that the regime has deployed to deadly effect in Aleppo province and elsewhere. Barrel bombs have been criticised for being indiscriminate and killing civilians. The Syrian raids come as the United States carries out air strikes against the Islamic State just across the border in neighbouring Iraq. The US strikes are intended to limit the advance of IS militants who have seized large swathes of territory in both Iraq and Syria declaring an Islamic ""caliphate."" The group emerged from Al-Qaedas one-time Iraq affiliate but has since broken with that organisation and grown into a cross-border militant group. It has been battling rival opposition fighters in Syria since early January after a backlash because of the groups abuses against civilians and rebels and its bid to dominate captured territory."

""As well as the 10 civilians killed in strikes on the bus... 21 others died in intense strikes on several neighbourhoods in the east of the city since dawn"" the organisation known as the White Helmets said. An AFP correspondent in Aleppo said Fridays bombing raids were the most intense in more than a week with dozens of barrel bombs - crude unguided explosive devices - hitting several eastern quarters of the city. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported intense strikes on the Castello road - a key rebel supply route out of divided Aleppo - giving a toll of eight dead civilians. A bus on the road was also hit on Wednesday resulting in seven civilian deaths. Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said the Castello road which for civilians in rebel-held areas is the route out of Aleppo was now ""effectively cut"". ""All movement is targeted be that buses or bystanders"" he said. Abdel Rahman said rocket fire on government-held areas of the city overnight caused several casualties but he was unable to provide an exact toll. A truce agreed by Russia and the United States in February has been violated nearly continuously around Aleppo where the regime and rebel groups have fought for control since 2012. More than 300 civilians have been killed in Aleppo since April as rebels have pounded government-controlled neighbourhoods with rocket and artillery fire and the regime has hit rebel areas with air raids. At least 280000 people have been killed and millions displaced since Syrias war started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests."

The crude unguided explosive device hit the Qaterji neighbourhood where an AFP photographer saw a street strewn with rubble as residents ran for safety and a rescuer rushed a bloodied child into an ambulance. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said nine civilians were killed in Qaterji and two others including a child were killed in the Mayssar neighbourhood of the northern city. Another five civilians were killed in two other districts and on the citys outskirts. In Qaterji a man stood in the middle of a road surrounded by debris and shouting angrily ""There are only civilians here there are no rebels!"" Further down the street two women and two children scrambled for safety past the mangled iron shutters of shops and buildings badly damaged by the barrel bomb the AFP photographer said. The rescuer his hair covered in white dust carried a child with a blood-covered face to an ambulance in which another wounded child already lay. A truce agreed by Russia and the United States in February has been violated nearly continuously around Aleppo where the regime and rebel groups have fought for control since 2012. Around 200000 people lived in eastern parts of Aleppo held by the rebels and the only route out of those areas has been cut following fierce fighting that erupted on Thursday. More than 300 civilians have been killed in Aleppo since April as rebels have pounded government-controlled neighbourhoods with rocket and artillery fire and the regime has hit rebel areas with air raids. At least 280000 people have been killed and millions displaced since Syrias war started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests."

A doctor receiving the casualties confirmed the death toll and said most of the injured were ""gravely wounded by shrapnel"". State news agency SANA said artillery fire killed two people and wounded nine others in the Bab Sharqi area of Old Damascus. The Observatory said shelling on Sunday hit several areas of the capital including the eastern district of Tabbaleh. It followed a drop in violence in Damascus since the implementation in July of a de-escalation zone in a rebel-held area to its east. Eastern Ghouta is one of four such zones agreed at May peace talks on the Syrian conflict sponsored by rebel backer Turkey and regime supporters Russia and Iran. SANA said four people were wounded on Saturday when two mortar rounds hit the Absasiyeen Square in the centre of the city. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since the countrys conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests. Damascus has been largely spared from the worst of the violence in the six-year war despite being shaken by two bomb attacks in recent weeks. On Wednesday three suicide bombers killed at least two people near the main police headquarters in Damascus in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group. IS group also claimed an October 2 bomb attack at a police station in the capital that killed at least 17 people."

__label__0	__topic__2 Syria gas kills hundreds Security Council meets August 21 2013 Syria gas kills hundreds Security Council meets. Dominic Evans Khaled Yacoub Oweis. Syrias opposition accused government forces of gassing hundreds of people on Wednesday by firing rockets that released deadly fumes over rebel-held Damascus suburbs killing men women and children as they slept. With the death toll estimated between 500 and 1300 what would be the worlds most lethal chemical weapons attack since the 1980s prompted an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council in New York. The council did not explicitly demand a U.N. investigation of the incident although it said clarity was needed and welcomed U.N. chief Ban Ki-moons calls for a prompt investigation by the U.N. inspection team in Syria led by Ake Sellstrom. An earlier Western-drafted statement submitted to the council seen by Reuters was not approved. The final version of the statement was watered down to accommodate objections from Russia and China diplomats said. Moscow and Beijing have vetoed previous Western efforts to impose U.N. penalties on Assad. Syrian Information Minister Omran Zoabi said the allegations were illogical and fabricated. President Bashar al-Assads officials have said they would never use poison gas against Syrians. The United States and European allies believe Assads forces have used small amounts of sarin before hence the current U.N. visit. Immediate international action is likely to be limited with the divisions among major powers that have crippled efforts to quell 2 1/2 years of civil war still much in evidence. Russia backed up Syrian government denials by saying it looked like a rebel provocation to discredit Assad. Britain voiced the opposite view: I hope this will wake up some who have supported the Assad regime to realize its murderous and barbaric nature Foreign Secretary William Hague said on a visit to Paris. France Britain the United States and others called for an immediate on-site investigation by U.N. chemical weapons inspectors who arrived in the Syrian capital only this week. Moscow urging an objective inquiry said the very presence of that team suggested government forces were not to blame. U.S. President Barack Obama has made the use of chemical weapons by Assads forces a red line that in June triggered more U.S. aid to the rebels. But previous smaller and disputed cases of their deployment have not brought the all-out military intervention rebel leaders have sought to break a stalemate. U.S. Senator John McCain a Republican critic of Obamas Syria policy said on Twitter that failure to penalize previous gas attacks had emboldened Assad: No consequence for Assad using chemical weapons & crossing red line he said. We shouldnt be surprised hes using them again. Images including some by freelance photographers supplied to Reuters showed scores of bodies - some of them small children - laid on the floor of a clinic with no visible signs of injury. Some showed people with foam around their mouths. A boy who survived from what activists say is a gas attack cries as he takes shelter inside a mosque in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus August 21 2013. REUTERS/Mohamed Abdullah The United States and others said it had no independent confirmation that chemical weapons had been used. The U.N. chief Ban said the head of the inspection team in Damascus was already discussing the latest claims with the government. SLEEPING DEAD Opposition activists cited death tolls ranging from about 500 to - by one account - some 1300 after shells and rockets fell around 3 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Wednesday. In 1988 3000 to 5000 Iraqi Kurds were gassed by Saddam Husseins forces at Halabja. One man who said he had retrieved victims in the suburb of Erbin told Reuters: We would go into a house and everything was in its place. Every person was in their place. They were lying where they had been. They looked like they were asleep. Slideshow (21 Images) Doctors interviewed described symptoms they believe point to sarin gas one of the agents Western powers accuse Damascus of having in an undeclared chemical weapons stockpile. An opposition monitoring group citing figures compiled from clinics in the Damascus suburbs put the death toll at 494 with 90 percent killed by gas the rest by bombs and conventional arms. The rebel Syrian National Coalition said 650 people died. Activists said rockets with chemical agents hit the Damascus suburbs of Ain Tarma Zamalka and Jobar during a fierce pre-dawn bombardment by government forces. The Damascus Media Office said 150 bodies were counted in Hammouriya 100 in Kfar Batna 67 in Saqba 61 in Douma 76 in Mouadamiya and 40 in Erbin. A nurse at Douma Emergency Collection facility Bayan Baker said: Many of the casualties are women and children. They arrived with their pupils constricted cold limbs and foam in their mouths. The doctors say these are typical symptoms of nerve gas victims. Extensive amateur video and photographs appeared on the Internet showing victims choking some foaming at the mouth. A video purportedly shot in the Kafr Batna neighborhood showed a room filled with more than 90 bodies many of them children and a few women and elderly men. Most of the bodies appeared ashen or pale but with no visible injuries. Other footage showed doctors treating people in makeshift clinics. One video showed the bodies of a dozen people lying on the floor of a clinic. A voice-over said they were members of a single family. In a corridor outside lay another five bodies. Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas sarin and VX nerve agents.

""Dozens more were wounded some of them critically"" the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said adding it was not immediately able to determine who carried out the Tuesday raids. The Syrian government its ally Russia and a US-led coalition have all carried out air strikes against IS in Raqa. The Observatory said there were fresh air strikes against the city on Wednesday one of which hit the town hall. It said those strikes appeared to have been carried out by the coalition. The coalition said it had carried out two strikes near Raqa on Monday hitting a bridge used by the jihadists as well as oil facilities. There are an estimated 300000 people still living in the city. Activists have accused IS of preventing civilians from leaving in order to use them as human shields against air strikes. Twin offensives aimed at severing ISs supply route to Raqa from the Turkish border have met fierce resistance from the jihadists in recent days. Near the border a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters has been encircling IS in the town of Manbij for days but has faced multiple suicide bombings by the jihadists. At least three IS suicide bombers attacked the Syrian Democratic Forces near Manbij on Tuesday the Observatory said. A separate Russian-backed offensive by government forces targeting the town of Tabqa 40 kilometres (25 miles) up the Euphrates Valley from Raqa suffered a major reverse on Monday. More than 40 troops and militia were killed in a jihadist counterattack launched on Sunday. The government forces which had advanced to within seven kilometres (four miles) of Tabqa airbase were driven back an estimated 20 kilometres (12 miles) to the west. IS has also been under attack in neighbouring Iraq. It has been driven out of the centre of its emblematic bastion Fallujah and pro-government forces have also renewed an offensive around Mosul the largest city under its control."

Abdah also said that this complete inaction towards Assads atrocities represents a bias in favor of a serial killer and a war criminal. At least 13 civilians mostly women and children were killed and over 30 others were wounded on Saturday when regime forces bombed a popular market in the District of Douma in Rural Damascus with heavy artillery. The Assad regimes air force continues to relentlessly hit residential areas in the Aleppo neighborhoods of Tariq al-Bab Bustan al-Qasr Salahaddin al-Mashhad al-Amiriyah Baidin al-Jandoul and Bani Zeid. No figure of the casualties resulted has been released by civil defense teams as they are still recovering victims from under the rubble. Activists said that at least 20 civilians including children were killed and many more wounded in intensifying aerial bombing of Aleppo on Friday by regime and Russian forces. Three more civilians were killed and around 15 others were injured on Friday evening in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime. (Source: Syrian Coalition) Twitter

Tags Syria Aleppo ceasefire truce civilian casualties sniper fire. An adult and a child have been killed in Syrias Aleppo city in the first deaths in areas covered by a US-Russian-brokered ceasefire since it began this week. Mohammad Alaa Mesouti was killed in a rebel-held area on Thursday while a child whose name has not yet been released was killed in a regime-held area of the divided city local activists and monitoring groups said. ""Regime snipers positioned the al-Izaa district fired into the besieged Zabadieh district killing civilian Mohammad Alaa Mesouti and wounding three others"" media activist Mohammad al-Halabi told The New Arab. Halabi added that a further two civilians were wounded in the Bustan al-Qasr district after regime troops shot into the rebel-held neighbourhood. An opposition source said that this was the first civilian casualty in Aleppo since the cessation of hostilities took effect three days ago. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has confirmed the civilian casualty in rebel-held Aleppo adding that a child was also killed in the regime-held al-Masharfeh district of the city by sniper fire. On Thursday 23 civilians including nine children were killed in regime air raids on a town in eastern Syria held by the Islamic State group [IS]. The truce does not include areas where IS and the former al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat Fath al-Sham are present. US President Barack Obama will meet with security aides on Friday amid deep unease over the ceasefire deal. Barely a week since the US and Russia agreed to halt bombing and let humanitarian aid into Aleppo the deals shaky implementation looks set to dominate the meeting which was ostensibly about countering IS. The agreement has somewhat quieted the bombs over Syrias second city but aid convoys have not been allowed to reach the roughly 250000 civilians besieged by regime forces in the rebel-held east. Basic resources in rebel-held East Aleppo are beginning to run low according to The New Arabs correspondent in the city.

Islamic State militants stormed an air base in northeast Syria on Sunday capturing it from government forces after days of fighting that cost more than 500 lives a monitoring group said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 346 Islamic State fighters were killed and more than 170 members of government forces had died since Tuesday in the fight over Tabqa base making it one of the deadliest confrontations between the two groups since the start of Syrias war. The Observatory which monitors violence in Syria through sources on the ground said fighting raged inside the air base on Sunday. It was the Syrian armys last foothold in an area otherwise controlled by Islamic State which has seized large areas of Syria and Iraq. In nearby Raqqa city an Islamic State stronghold there was celebratory gunfire and several mosques announced through their loudspeakers that the base had fallen to the Islamists and cheered God is greatest a witness told Reuters. IS fighters displayed the severed heads of Syrian army soldiers in the city square the witness said adding that Syrian warplanes were heard over Raqqa following the air base attack. Earlier on Sunday the Syrian air force had bombed areas around the base. Syrian state television said that after fierce battles the military was regrouping. Citing a military source it said there was a successful evacuation of the airport and that the army was continuing strikes on terrorist groups in the area which it said had suffered heavy losses. Syrian state media gave no figure for the number of people killed in the clashes. Islamic State had also trapped around 150 retreating Syrian soldiers in an area near the base and was believed to be holding them captive the Observatory said. Residents of Tabqa city tour the streets on motorcycles carrying flags in celebration after Tabqa air base fell to Islamic State militants in nearby Raqqa city August 24 2014. REUTERS/Stringer The Syrian army sent reinforcements to the base overnight on Friday to fight Islamic State which controls roughly a third of northern and eastern Syria. Syrian television had shown footage of army forces defending the base on Saturday who had said it was safe from Islamic States advances. Many of the Islamic State fighters died after Syrian warplanes bombarded the area the Observatory said. MILITARY BASES Slideshow (3 Images) Islamic State a radical offshoot of al Qaeda has taken three Syrian military bases in the area in recent weeks boosted by arms seized in Iraq. Syria is calculating that the IS push to reshape the Middle East will eventually force the West to deal with President Bashar al-Assad as the only way to tackle the threat sources familiar with Syrian government thinking have said. Elsewhere in Syria the group withdrew from northern areas it controlled outside the city of Homs on Sunday and retreated east after coming under attack from rival Islamist fighters the Observatory said. Fighters from the group withdrew from a headquarters north of Homs on the orders of their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the Observatory said citing sources in the area. They said IS gave up the territory to Nusra Front al Qaedas official wing in Syria. As well as Nusra Front Western-backed rebels have also been fighting IS in Syria but have regularly been defeated by the group which in June declared an Islamic caliphate in the territory it controls. Activists have accused the Syrian army of avoiding confrontations with IS because it has weakened rival rebel groups also battling Assad.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the deaths came in three separate clashes around the town in Aleppo province of northern Syria. At least 22 of the jihadists were killed in fighting on the border between Aleppo and Raqa province where IS has its de-facto capital. That battle marked the first time in months that fighters from the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) have expanded their attacks to the edge of Raqa province. Four YPG fighters were killed in those clashes with the Kurdish forces capturing the strategic Tal Baghdaq hilltop the Observatory said. The other jihadist deaths came in clashes to the west and south of Kobane the key border town that Kurdish forces recaptured on January 26. IS fighters began advancing on the town last September and at one point looked poised to overrun it cementing their grip on a long stretch of the Syria-Turkey border. But YPG ground forces backed by US-led air strikes were able to repel the IS fighters. Since the towns recapture YPG forces have been expanding their control from Kobane into the surrounding countryside where they have largely encountered little resistance from the jihadists. But the Observatory said the fighting around Tel Baghdaq on the Aleppo-Raqa border was some of the heaviest in the region since Kobane fell. The group said the US-led coalition fighting IS had also carried out air strikes in the region on Sunday but there was no initial information on casualties in the raids. The IS group has declared an Islamic ""caliphate"" in territory it controls in Syria and Iraq with the provincial capital of Raqa province serving as its effective capital. More than 210000 people have been killed in Syria since the countrys conflict began with anti-government demonstrations in March 2011."

Iran Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif Iran - Live News - Middle East - News - Top Tweet Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has reiterated the Islamic Republics stance on the need for the establishment of an international fact-finding committee to investigate the recent chemical attack in Syria. Zarif made the call during phone conversations on Monday with the European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini as well as his Russian Omani Syrian and Algerian counterparts Sergei Lavrov Yusuf bin Alawi Walid al-Muallem and Mourad Medelci respectively. The senior officials exchanged views about the terrible suspected chemical attack in the Syrian town of Khan Shaikhoun in Idlib Province which killed at least 86 people. Anti-Damascus militants and Western countries rushed to blame the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad for the incident without providing any evidence to support their accusations. Syria has categorically denied carrying out the gas attack with the foreign minister stressing that an Idlib airstrike had targeted a depot where terrorists stored chemical weapons.
__label__0	"__topic__2 Syria rebels battle to break Aleppo siege Date of publication 29 October 2016 Fresh fighting shook Aleppo on Saturday as rebels battled to break a siege of the city by the Syrian regime. Fresh fighting shook Aleppo on Saturday as rebels battled to break a siege of the city by the Syrian regime accused by Washington of using starvation as a weapon of war. Opposition fighters unleashed a barrage of rockets on the government-held western side of the divided city on Friday as they announced a major offensive aimed at reopening vital supply lines. ""In just a few days we will open the way for our besieged brothers"" rebel commander Abu Mustafa told AFP. The rebel fire has killed at least 21 civilians including two children according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ""Fighting continues on the western outskirts of Aleppo where rebels have been making advances"" the British-based monitoring group which has a network of sources on the ground said Saturday. More than 1500 fighters from the provinces of Aleppo and Idlib to the west were attacking government-controlled districts of the city along a front stretching for 15 kilometres (nine miles) it said. The Observatory reported Russian air raids on Aleppos western front lines but said that a halt to Moscows aerial bombing of the rebel-held east of the city was holding. An AFP correspondent who visited Dahiyet al-Assad where rebels seized ground on Friday saw deserted streets and extensive damage to buildings as airstrikes and artillery fire hit the area. Fierce fighting shelling and car bombs killed at least 18 regime forces and allied fighters on Friday according to Observatory which was unable to provide a toll for the rebels. More than 250000 people live under government siege in the eastern half of Aleppo which the army began an operation to retake several weeks ago. Syrias second city Aleppo has been devastated by some of the heaviest fighting of the five-year civil war that began with anti-government protests and has since killed more than 300000 people. Much of the once-bustling economic hub has been reduced to rubble by air and artillery bombardment including barrel bombs - crude unguided explosive devices that cause indiscriminate damage."

The deadly raid comes amid a massive aerial offensive targeting opposition-held areas across Aleppo city and province that began in December 15. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the bombing campaign has killed hundreds mostly civilians and forced thousands of families to flee their homes. ""The number of people killed in an air strike this morning against the market area of Atareb village has risen to 21 including three children"" said the Observatory adding the toll was likely to rise. Activists distributed video showing scenes of chaos with bodies lying amid mounds of grey rubble in what was clearly a market. The amateur footage shows a woman in a white headscarf screaming as she leaned over the body of a loved one. Another image showed a man attending to a boy whose leg had been ripped off. It was unclear whether the child was alive or dead. ""The area that was struck today is a market area thats why there were so many civilians killed"" said Aleppo-based activist Abu Omar. ""The regime is hitting back against the civilians who support the revolt"" against President Bashar al-Assad he added. Swathes of Aleppo city and province have been out of army control since 2012. Human Rights Watch has accused Syrias regime of ""wreaking disaster"" with its air strikes on the area. More than 150000 people have been killed in Syrias three-year war which broke out after the regime unleashed a massive crackdown against a protest movement demanding political change. The violence has forced nearly half of Syrias population to flee their homes."

At least 45 people have been killed in the US latest airstrike in Syria. (presstv) - At least 45 people have been killed in the US latest airstrike in Syria. According to local sources on Monday the civilians were killed after US jets targeted the al-Touseeiyah district in the city of Raqqah. The incident comes just one day after the so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that more than 3000 people including nearly 1000 civilians have been killed during the past month. The US-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against what are said to be Isis targets inside Syria since September 2014 without any authorization from the Damascus government or a UN mandate. The military alliance has repeatedly been accused of targeting and killing civilians. It has also been largely incapable of achieving its declared goal of destroying Isis. The Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates in two separate letters sent to UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres and rotating President of the UN Security Council Amr Abdellatif Aboulatta on August 24 stated that the US-led coalition was perpetrating war crimes and crimes against humanity through aerial bombardment of residential neighborhoods.

Tags Syria Damascus Douma Regime Rebels Civilians Bashar al-Assad Airstrikes Syrian regime airstrikes on a rebel-held region near Damascus killed at least 22 civilians on Monday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The highest toll was in Douma the largest town in the Eastern Ghouta region where raids killed 16 civilians including at least one child and wounded 22 it said. Five more civilians were killed in the town of Sabqa and one in the town of Harasta both also in Eastern Ghouta the Observatory said. The Eastern Ghouta region is adjacent to the capitals eastern neighbourhood of Jobar which is divided between regime and rebel control. Last month the armed opposition launched a surprise assault against regime forces from Jobar but was repelled after a week of fighting. Eastern Ghouta has been under a devastating government siege since 2012 which has trapped over 300000 civilains and is targeted regularly by airstrikes and artillery. It is the last remaining opposition stronghold near Damascus where a string of local ""reconciliation deals"" have seen villages and towns brought back under the control of President Bashar al-Assads government. The World Health Organization last week demanded immediate humanitarian access to the area saying residents are in desperate need of medical attention. Time is running out for the people of East Ghouta. As health needs increase available resources are being depleted day by day. Our main goal now is to provide access to lifesaving care for thousands of vulnerable men women and children immediately said Elizabeth Hoff WHO Representative in Syria. All 3 public hospitals and 17 public health care centres in East Ghouta are nonfunctioning and inaccessible to the population the WHO said in a statement. The regime is fighting to push rebels out of five neighbourhoods in Damascus. The rebels control almost all of Qabun and Tishreen in the northeast as well as half of Jobar in the east. They are also present in Barzeh in the north and Tadamun in the south but the neighbourhoods are covered by a truce with the regime. The Syrian conflict began when the Baath regime in power since 1963 and led by President Bashar al-Assad responded with military force to peaceful protests demanding democratic reforms during the Arab Spring wave of uprisings triggering an armed rebellion fueled by mass defections from the Syrian army. According to independent monitors hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed in the war mostly by the regime and its powerful allies and millions have been displaced both inside and outside of Syria. The brutal tactics pursued mainly by the regime which have included the use of chemical weapons sieges mass executions and torture against civilians have led to war crimes investigations. Read Also"

More than 40 people were also wounded in the attack on the Sheikh Maqsoud area the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a district next to the only way in and out of rebel-held parts of the northern city the Castello road. An escalation in air and artillery strikes in recent weeks around the road has made it virtually impassable putting hundreds of thousands of people in Aleppo under effective siege. Hundreds of people have been killed in Aleppo since peace talks broke off in April as Syrias President Bashar al-Assad seeks to regain control of what was Syrias largest pre-war city now split between rebel and government sectors. Rebels have said in the past their attacks on Sheikh Maqsoud were in response to YPG attempts to cut the Castello road. The YPG controls nearly all of Syrias northern frontier with Turkey and has been a close ally of the United States in the campaign against Islamic State (IS) group in Syria. Many rebels in western Syria do not trust the YPG because they say it cooperates with Damascus rather than fighting it an accusation the YPG has denied. Heavy Bombardment Sheikh Maqsoud has been under intense bombardment since mid-February which has killed more than 132 civilians and injured around 900 more the Observatory said. A 48-hour ceasefire in Aleppo announced by Russia on Thursday has had little impact on fighting and air strikes and shelling have continued in and around the city since then. Three people two of them children died and more than nine people were injured by barrel bombs dropped from helicopters in the city the Observatory said on Saturday. The White Helmets a group of civil defence emergency workers operating in rebel-held areas said on Twitter one of their buildings in Haritan in the north Aleppo countryside was hit by an air strike on Saturday. There were no injuries. The Observatory also said on Saturday that rebels had captured three villages south of Aleppo from government control - Zeitan Khalsa and Barna - causing significant losses among government forces and their allies. The villages are near a main highway within rebel territory linking Aleppo with the capital Damascus to the south. They lie in an area captured by government forces at the end of last year in a large offensive assisted by Iranian-backed militias and Russian air power. But the Syrian Observatory said there has been a lack of Russian air support during this weeks battle for these villages. At least 86 members of Syrian government forces and its allies - who include members of the Lebanese group Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed militias - were killed in fighting in the south Aleppo area in the past four days the Observatory said. The numbers could not be independently confirmed. The rebels are fighting alongside the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front which like IS group was excluded from a February ceasefire and from the Geneva peace talks.

Another man and a woman were killed in rocket fire in the nearby town of Kafr Awid. Idlib province is controlled by the Army of Conquest an alliance of rebel groups and jihadists including the Fateh al-Sham Front which changed its name from Al-Nusra Front after breaking off ties with Al-Qaeda. According to the Observatory heavy bombardment has battered the northwest province in recent days.

Russian military jets are seen at Hmeymim air base in Syria June 18 2016 (TRT World and Agencies) The death toll from Russian and Syrian strikes in the opposition-held city of Al Quriyah has risen to 82 people including 58 civilians the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Sunday. ""Three Russian and Syrian regime air raids on the region of Al-Quriyah southeast of Deir Ezzor city killed 58 civilians"" the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The rights group added that 24 other people were killed without specifying whether they were civilians or DAESH fighters. DAESH holds around 60 percent of Deir Ezzor city the capital of the province of the same name which is next to the jihadist-held Raqqa province. Government forces were also fighting rebels in northern neighbourhoods of the city in a bid to halt rocket fire on government-held districts. Elsewhere in Syria in Manbij US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) overran a key road junction in the citys south after capturing nearby grain silos overnight. Manbij lies in the eastern plains of Aleppo province which has become a battleground between an array of competing armed groups including Al-Qaeda non-jihadist rebels and government forces as well as the SDF and DAESH. Members of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) attend the funeral of eight fellow fighters who died during an assault against the Islamic State (IS) group in the town of Manbij on June 24 2016. (AFP) The Raqa Revolutionaries Brigades - one of the Arab components of the Kurdish-dominated alliance - also said the SDF had seized the silos and pushed into the city. In 2014 DAESH took control of Manbij it was a key transit point for foreign fighters and funds as well as a trafficking hub for oil antiquities and other plundered goods. The SDF launched its offensive to take Manbij on May 31 driving across the Euphrates River from the east with military advice from some 200 US special forces troops. According to the Observatory DAESH has lost 463 fighters in the battle and the SDF has lost at least 89. A two-day freeze on fighting brokered by Moscow and Washington this month expired without renewal.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which monitors violence in Syria said the air force conducted 60 strikes on the Eastern Ghouta district on Thursday and during the night. Twelve children and 11 fighters were among the dead it said. High death tolls from air force attacks are not rare but the Observatory said the focused barrage was a response to rocket attacks by Islam Army insurgents on Thursday which killed 10 people in Damascus. A message on Thursday on a Twitter account thought to belong to Islam Army chief Zahran Alloush said Thursdays rocket attack was a taste of what the Syrian military had done to Eastern Ghouta. Alloush described Damascus as a ""military zone"" and said his group would respond to any air force strikes. Islam Army was formed by a merger of rebel factions in 2013 and has received backing from Saudi Arabia. The U.N. says 200000 people have been killed since 2011 in Syrias civil war which started with peaceful protests against President Bashar al-Assad.

The blasts sent a massive ball of fire into the sky causing widespread damage and panic among residents many of whom are supporters of President Bashar Assad. One resident said the explosions were so strong they cracked the walls of some buildings. Thick smoke and dust could be seen from a distance as explosions shook the ground. A video posted online by activists showed a huge ball of fire over Homs neighborhoods. The explosions in Homs reflected the see-saw nature of the conflict. It showed that despite significant advances by Assads military rebels could still strike back. An official at the governors office in Homs said about 10 rockets slammed into the neighborhood of Zahra and the nearby sports stadium sparking a large fire and causing several casualties. He said the explosions caused massive destruction and wounded at least 130 people. He didnt offer a number for those killed. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with government regulations. He did not give a casualty figure. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which closely monitors the fighting in Syria said 40 people were killed and 120 were wounded some critically when rockets struck an arms depot igniting the fire. A resident of Homs corroborated that account saying he heard blasts for more than an hour after the first explosion. He said they could be heard from the overwhelmingly pro-regime districts of Wadi Dahab and al-Walid where the regime is known to keep arms depots. ""Rockets were falling on the area ... when the arms depot began to explode but we dont know if the rockets triggered the blasts"" he said speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. He said the explosions were so strong that ""they shook parts of the city."" They also shattered all windows in the area and cracked walls he added. He said he spoke with Syrian Arab Red Crescent paramedics who told him that at least 22 bodies were taken to hospitals. The explosions in Homs coincided with a rare trip by President Bashar Assad to a former rebel bastion near the capital Damascus to mark Army Day. Assads visit to Daraya is his first known public trip outside the capital his seat of power in more than a year. He visited the battered Baba Amr district in the central city of Homs after troops seized it from rebels in March 2012. It also is the latest sign of confidence from Assad whose troops have been on the offensive and scored significant gains against rebels in recent months. Assad pledged victory over troops fighting to topple him. More than 100000 people have been killed since the uprising against the Assad familys four-decade rule began in March 2011. The revolt later escalated into a civil war which has uprooted millions of people from their homes."

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said four civilians had been killed and more than 70 wounded in a massive multi-district assault by the rebel coalition. Another five rebel fighters were killed in the clashes that erupted with government forces in western Aleppo. Rebels fired several hundred rockets and projectiles into at least seven government-held neighbourhoods with the army returning fire and regime aircraft carrying out raids Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. He described the clashes as some of the fiercest yet in the government-held parts of the city particularly in the district of Zahra already partly under opposition control and home to an air force intelligence base. The new alliance calling itself Ansar Sharia including various Islamist factions and the jihadist Al-Nusra Front Al-Qaedas affiliate in Syria. Online a statement announcing the grouping pledged ""victory for the Muslims of Aleppo"". Control of Aleppo once Syrias economic powerhouse has been divided between government and rebel forces since shortly after fighting began there in mid-2012. The regime largely controls the west of the city with rebels from different factions present in the east. The situation is largely reversed in the countryside surrounding the city and both government and rebel forces have at times sought to encircle their opponents and besiege them. In recent months Al-Nusra has allied elsewhere with Islamist rebels to win large swathes of territory from the regime particularly in northwestern Idlib. Most of that province is now under rebel control after a grouping named the Army of Conquest which includes Al-Nusra and its allies seized the provincial capital and most remaining government strongholds. More than 230000 people have been killed in Syria since the countrys conflict began in March 2011."

__label__1	__topic__2 Rebels launch assault in Syrias divided Aleppo Tuesday 12 July 2016 Rebels launch assault in Syrias divided Aleppo. Rebel fighters launched a major assault on government-held districts of Syrias long-divided Aleppo on Monday after the regime severed their only remaining supply route into the battleground city. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo has been ravaged by the war that began with anti-government protests in 2011 and which has since killed more than 280000 people. Rebels launched the offensive at dawn to reopen the Castello Road their last lifeline into the northern city an AFP correspondent said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 19 regime forces were killed Monday when rebels blew up a tunnel in the Old City. Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said: The opposition has not advanced because of the heavy aerial bombardment the regime is carrying out on the areas where fighting is underway. Air raids on the rebel-held parts of Aleppo killed 13 civilians Monday the Observatory said most of them in the Bab al-Maqam neighborhood near the front line. An AFP journalist saw rescue workers help a stocky shirtless man out of the rubble in Bab al-Maqam his face and thick beard caked in dust. The unidentified man entered a field hospital and embraced the limp bodies of two young boys. He was martyred. Hes gone he said crying over the body of one them. Several rounds of UN-brokered talks to end the conflict have failed but the UNs special envoy Staffan de Mistura said Monday that a crucial moment had been reached in efforts to secure a political settlement. But despite the diplomatic flurry fighting has intensified in Aleppo divided between government forces in the west and rebels in the east since mid-2012. Barrage of shells Rebels fired a barrage of at least 300 shells into western Aleppo killing nine civilians the Observatory said. Ahmed a resident of the government-controlled west of the city said his home in the Syria quarter was completely destroyed. The shells have rained down on the western neighborhoods since 4:30 am he told AFP. Residents lifted debris in the Syria quarter and helped neighbors gather their belongings so they could leave in search of shelter elsewhere. Mahmud Abu Malak a spokesman for the Nureddin al-Zanki rebel group described fierce fighting. All kinds of heavy artillery and machine-guns are being used in the assault which is intended to ease the pressure on the Mallah and Handarat fronts he said referring to areas near the rebel supply route into Aleppo. The Castello Road route was effectively severed last Thursday when government forces seized a hilltop within firing range. The advance leaves the opposition-held east of the city cut off and raises the prospect of total siege. On Sunday at least 29 opposition fighters were killed when rebels launched a fruitless assault to push government forces back from the road and reopen the route. Watch: Regional international diplomats struggle over Aleppo Play Video Meagre food stocks The severing of the Castello Road has already created shortages of food and fuel in the east of Aleppo with local market stalls sparsely stocked. There are very few vegetables today because the Castello Road is closed said Abu Mohamed a vendor in the Bustan al-Qasr neighborhood. If we hadnt planted eggplant and zucchini inside the city we wouldnt have had any vegetables at all he said pointing to his meagre stock of vegetables. Residents also described searching in vain for fuel whether for vehicles or home use. The UN says nearly 600000 Syrians live in besieged areas of the country most surrounded by government forces although rebels also use the tactic. The latest violence comes despite an extension until early Tuesday of a nationwide truce declared last week by the government to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. In northwest Idlib province 17 people including two children were killed in air strikes which the Observatory said were carried out by either regime or allied Russian warplanes. US Secretary of State John Kerry will travel to Moscow this week to seek common ground on how to deal with the ongoing bloodshed it was announced Monday. The current truce does not cover extremists from ISIS or the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front. Also Monday ISIS militants entered the historic city of Palmyra in central Syria for the first time since being defeated there by regime forces in March. But they were killed and the attack was now over according to the Observatory. ISIS fighters also claimed a suicide attack on a rival rebel group in the town of Dumeir east of Damascus on Sunday that killed 16 people.

Clashes among the Jeish al-Islam Faylaq al-Rahman and Jeish al-Fastat terrorist groups in Eastern Ghouta near Damascus in less than one month have killed over 350 militants. ""50 militants were killed during infighting among the terrorist groups in Eastern Ghouta near Damascus in past few days"" the SOHR announced in a statement. Other media sources also said that two Syrian civilians were killed in clashes among Jeish al-Islam Faylaq al-Rahman and Jeish al-Fastat terrorist groups in Eastern Ghouta. The SOHR announced on Sunday that clashes among the terrorist groups in Eastern Ghouta in the past 20 (since April 28 ) days had brought the total number of militant casualties to over 300. Most of the dead militants are members of Jeish al-Islam and al-Nusra Front and tens of them belong to Faylaq al-Rahman group. According to the SOHR tens of civilians including children and a female doctor were also among the casualties of the terrorist groups infighting. Military sources had announced earlier this month that infighting had intensified among the terrorist groups across the country mainly in Aleppo Damascus and Idlib provinces claiming the lives of hundreds of the militants in a matter of weeks. ""The farms of Douma in the Eastern part of Damascus province have also been the scenes of heavy fighting among the terrorist rivals which have claimed the lives of many militants"" they added. ""Abu Nasr the commander of Faylaq al-Sham in Hama was killed by the rival groups and his body and the body of one of his comrades were found in farms near the village of Juzef in Idlib province"" they went on to say. ""A vast wave of bomb attacks against the positions of Ahrar al-Sham in Idlib caused the terrorist group to intensify security measures across the province to the border with Turkey"" the sources said. ""Ahrar al-Sham also launched an operation across Idlib to capture opposing groups members including those from the ISIL (Islamic State ISIS IS and Daesh)"" they added. ""Suicide attacks killed at least 15 members of Ahrar al-Sham including four field commanders in the town of Banish during the last week while almost 30 more were wounded"" the sources went on to say. Majed al-Sadeq and Abu Jaber were among the killed commanders in Banish. Saud al-Asaf the commander of Ansar al-Haq affiliated to Ahrar al-Sham and three of his comrades were killed in a bomb explosion in the small town of Maasaran near Maraat al-Nuaman"" the sources said. ""The ISIL and its terrorist rivals also engaged in fierce clashes in the Northern part of Aleppo province near Marea which left scores of the terrorists dead from both sides"" They added. ""The ISIL positions in al-Sham desert near Qalamoun in the Northeastern part of Damascus province and near al Zabat mountain and Baar al-Qasab were pounded by the terrorists mortars"" the sources said. The military sources further added that the recent ceasefires in Aleppo and Lattakia can give the terrorist groups to decrease their differences and gather in a united front against the ISIL which will give the western countries and meddlers the opportunity to lead this front and increase their role in the region specially in the crisis-hit Syria. 12"

__label__0	__topic__2 Obama says is shifting to domestic priorities from Syria focus September 12 2013 Obama says is shifting to domestic priorities from Syria focus. Mark Felsenthal. President Barack Obama said on Thursday he is shifting his focus to domestic priorities from a tense period during which he sought congressional approval to use military force against Syria for its suspected use of chemical weapons. Even as we have been spending a lot of time on the Syria issue and making sure that international attention is focused on the horrible tragedy that occurred there it is still important to recognize that weve got a lot more stuff to do here in this government the president said before a meeting with his Cabinet at the White House. The president said he hopes meetings between Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will result in action to eliminate Syrias ability to use chemical weapons again. Obama has asked Congress to authorize military strikes against Syria in response to what the United States says was a chemical weapons attack by the government that killed more than 1400 people on August 21. The issue is on hold pending diplomatic efforts to disarm Syria of chemical weapons. I am hopeful that the discussions that Secretary Kerry had with Foreign Minister Lavrov as well as some of the other players in this can yield a concrete result Obama said. U.S. President Barack Obama speaks during a cabinet meeting in the West Wing of the White House in Washington September 12 2013. REUTERS/Jason Reed Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov were to hold talks on Syria in Geneva. The president cited the budget immigration and implementation of his signature healthcare legislation as concerns he is turning to. The administration faces daunting obstacles on all three fronts and a ticking clock on the budget in particular. Congressional Republicans have sought to eliminate funding for the health law known as Obamacare and want the president to agree to spending cuts in exchange for raising the nations debt limit. Lawmakers must pass legislation to continue funding for government operations by the end of the month or force a government shutdown. Failure to raise the nations debt limit after a date expected in mid-October would trigger a debt default. The administration is also scrambling to make sure Americans lacking health coverage sign up for insurance under the new law starting October 1. Were going to focus on some specific issues including managing some of the budget debates that are going to take place over the next several weeks Obama said. Were going to be talking about the rollout of the Affordable Care Act. Reporting by Mark Felsenthal and Roberta Rampton; Editing by Vicki Allen Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

__label__1	"__topic__2 Shelling of rebel bastion near Syria capital kills 19 Monitor Tuesday 4 Apr 2017 Shelling of rebel bastion near Syria capital kills 19 Monitor At least 19 civilians were killed on Tuesday in heavy aerial bombardment of several opposition-held towns east of the Syrian capital a monitoring group said. Six children were among the dead in Eastern Ghouta the largest rebel bastion near Damascus the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. ""It was a series of air strikes throughout the day and the death toll may still rise"" the Britain-based group added. He said civilians had died in Jisreen Kafr Batna and the largest of the towns in Eastern Ghouta Douma. An AFP photographer in Douma saw half a dozen wounded children sitting on the floor of a makeshift clinic caked in dust and blood as they awaited treatment. But most of the victims - 14 - died in air strikes on an area between the opposition-held towns of Hammuriyah and Saqba. Another AFP photographer in Saqba saw residents scrambling over rubble and through clouds of dust tossing debris aside as they searched for signs of life. One man sat atop a small mountain of cinderblocks clothes and furniture with his head in his hands. The Observatory said Tuesdays bombardment brought to 49 the number killed in Eastern Ghouta in two days of attacks. ""There has been fierce artillery shelling and air strikes since yesterday and 165 people total have been wounded"" Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. Eastern Ghouta has been under a devastating government siege since 2012 and is targeted regularly by air strikes and artillery. It is the last remaining opposition stronghold near Damascus where a string of local ""reconciliation deals"" have seen villages and towns brought back under the control of President Bashar al-Assads government. Hundreds of people were killed in Eastern Ghouta in chemical weapons strikes allegedly carried out by government troops in August 2013. On Tuesday at least 58 people were killed in a suspected chemical attack on the northwestern Syrian town of Khan Sheikhun according to the Observatory. Dozens more suffered respiratory problems and symptoms including vomiting fainting and foaming at the mouth the monitor and doctors at the scene said. More than 320000 people have been killed and millions displaced since Syrias war started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests."

On 15 Feb 2016 Turkish Prime Minister Ahmed Davutoglu said Ankara will not allow the town of Azaz in northern Syria to fall to the Kurdish YPG forces and promised the ""harshest reaction"" if the group attempts to re-take the city. From past month turkey started shelling Kurdish YPG fighters who raids Syrian rebels from a Menagh military air base south of the town of Azaz and near the Turkish border. The Menagh base had previously been controlled by the Ahrar ash-Sham rebel group which seized it in August of 2013. Ahrar ash-Sham militants at the base had been supported by Al-Nusra terrorists and some extremist groups coming from Turkey.The town is highly valued as a logistical supply route close to the TurkishSyrian border.

Archimandrite Emanuel Youkhana who works in support of persecuted Christians in the region said 15 young Assyrians had been killed. He said Around 15 young Assyrians are martyred. Many of them were fighting to defend and protect the villages and families. ISIS terrorists have reportedly begun murdering some of the Christian hostages captured from villages in north-east Syria since Monday. The number of Assyrian Christian men women and children abducted in the last three days stands at 220 the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said today. Other agencies said the number could be as high as 350. The Catholic charity Aid to the Church in Need (ACN) quoted villagers of Tel Hormizd who had fought to defend their homes saying that one woman has been beheaded and two men were shot. Some 12 men and two women were abducted from their village. The Assyrian International News Agency reported that negotiations were under way to free some of the hostages with Arab Sheiks in Hassakeh city acting as intermediaries between ISIS and Assyrian leaders. All remaining villagers have now fled to the nearby cities of Hassake or Qamishli. Archimandrite Youkhana said almost 1000 families had arrived in the two cities and registered as displaced. Mondays raids took place in the villages of Tal Shamiram and Tal Hurmoz. Sources told SOHR that they heard ISIS members saying via wireless devices that they had detained crusaders. The churches in Tal Shamiran and Tal Hurmoz have been torched the charity said. The attacks come as Syrian Kurdish fighters continue to advance into ISIS-held territory. In Tal Tamr there have been fierce clashes between ISIS and Kurdish YPG.

Thirteen militants of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Levant organization were killed Monday during battles with other opposition armed groups in Idlib countryside. Thirteen militants of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Levant organization were killed Monday during battles with other opposition armed groups in Idlib countryside. The opposition UK-based Syrian observatory indicated that among the killed was a local Libyan emir who was killed during violent clashes with gunmen in the vicinity of Hazano town several kilometers away from the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey. Another seven people of a local armed group were also killed in the clash which took place after al-Qaeda terrorist organization members tried to arrest two persons of the town residents. Earlier ISIL gunmen seized the headquarters of al-Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra terrorist group in the Shaddadi area in Hasakah countryside north-east of the country. Moreover in Azaz situation is still unstable after recent clashes between the ISIL militiamen and Storm of North Brigade of the so-called free Syrian army. The free army accused the ISIL of violating the cease-fire agreement by abstaining from releasing many of the detainees. Recently fierce clashes erupted between the ISIL Al-Nusra Front and the free army in the wake of disputes on power and control sharing over areas not reclaimed so far by the Syrian army. The Syrian national military launched a wide-scale military operation in May 2013 in the countrys main provinces to restore security and release citizens from terrorist threats. Syria was hit by a violent unrest since mid-March 2011 where the Syrian government accuses foreign actors of orchestrating the conflict by supporting the militant opposition groups with arms and money.

The so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) militant group has executed 700 members of a tribe it has been battling in eastern Syria during the past two weeks the majority of them civilians a human rights monitoring group says. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which has tracked violence on all sides of the three-year-old conflict said on Saturday that reliable sources reported beheadings were used to execute many of the al-Sheitaat tribe which is from Deir al-Zour province. The conflict between ISIL and the al-Sheitaat tribe who number about 70000 flared after the militants took over two oil fields in July. Those who were executed are all al-Sheitaat Observatory director Rami Abdel-Rahman said by telephone from Britain. Some were arrested judged and killed. Straddling parts of Iraq and Syria ISIL has swept across northern Iraq in recent weeks pushing back Kurdish regional forces and driving tens of thousands of Muslims Christians and members of the Yazidi religious minority from their homes. The insurgents are also tightening their grip in parts of Syria of which they now control roughly a third mostly rural areas in the north and east. An activist in Deir al-Zour who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters that 300 men were executed in one day in the town of Ghraneij one of the three main towns of the al-Sheitaat tribal heartland when ISIL stormed the town earlier this week. Another opposition activist from Deir al-Zour said residents of al-Sheitaat towns had been given three days to leave. Civilians fleeing al-Sheitaat towns had either taken sanctuary in other villages or travelled to Iraq he said. More than 170000 people have been reportedly killed in Syrias conflict which pits overwhelmingly Takfiri militants against the Syrian government since March 2011. NTJHH

Earlier reports said that the Russian fighter jets carried out several combat flights over the ISIL terrorists concentration centers in the Eastern part of Homs province and inflicted major losses on the militants. Over 20 ISIL terrorists were killed and fifty more were wounded after the groups positions in two regions of al-Duweh and Jabal Hayyan in the Western and Southwestern parts of the ancient city of Palmyra (Tadmur) came under the heavy airstrikes of the Russian warplanes.

Tags Syria Airstrikes Truce Ceasefire Assad Rebels Aleppo At least five civilians were killed in aerial bombardment targeting a rebel-controlled neighbourhood east of Aleppo on Sunday as the opposition continued to mull over a US-Russia truce deal due to take effect on Monday. Dozens were injured when ""government helicopters targeted the residential area"" activist Mansoor Hussain told The New Arab noting that ""Qabr al-Engleezi was also hit by warplanes."" The reports come just a day after more than 100 civilians were killed in regime-bombardment on Idlip and Aleppo while five others were killed on the outskirts of the capital. ""People were shopping before the Eid al-Adha next week which is why the toll is so high"" said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman after Saturdays strikes. SOHR added that many of wounded are in severe condition and many others remain unaccounted for which is likely to increase the death toll. The Army of Conquest - led by the Fateh al-Sham Front which changed its name from al-Nusra Front after renouncing ties with al-Qaeda - is regularly bombarded by pro-government forces. Close to 500000 people have been killed since Syrias conflict first erupted in March 2011 and several attempts at securing a long-lasting truce have faltered. State news agency SANA on Saturday reported that Syrian President Bashar al-Assads government ""approved the agreement"" brokered between US and Russia. Key regime ally Iran welcomed the plan on Sunday and called for ""comprehensive monitoring"" of the truce particularly along Syrias volatile borders. ""The continuation and sustainability of a ceasefire relies on the creation of a comprehensive monitoring mechanism in particular control of borders in order to stop the dispatch of fresh terrorists as well as weapons and financial resources for the terrorists"" he said. But Syrias main opposition group the High Negotiations Committee - which brings together political dissidents with armed rebel factions - had yet to formally respond. Read Also"

We call on the international community to support the FSA as it is the only disciplined and organized revolutionary force that it is committed to achieving the goals of the revolution and defending the Syrian people against the massacres of Assad and ISIS.

The agreement had stalled leaving thousands of people from both government-besieged and rebel-besieged areas stranded at two transit points on the citys outskirts before the explosion occurred. Pro-Damascus media outlets said a suicide attacker detonated a car bomb and killed at least 22 people. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the death toll was at least 24. Footage on state TV showed bodies lying next to charred buses with their windows blown out and vehicles in flames. The blast hit buses in the Rashidin area on Aleppos outskirts. The vehicles had been waiting since Friday to cross from rebel-held territory into the government-controlled city itself. The convoy was carrying residents and pro-government fighters from the rebel-besieged Shia villages of al-Foua and Kefraya in nearby Idlib province. They had left under a deal where in exchange hundreds of Sunni insurgents and their families were granted safe passage from Madaya a government-besieged town near Damascus. But a delay in the agreement had left all those evacuated stuck at transit points on Aleppos outskirts since late on Friday. Residents of al-Foua and Kefraya were waiting in the Rashidin area. The rebels and residents of Madaya near Damascus were waiting at the government-held Ramousah bus garage a few miles away. They were to be transported to the opposition stronghold of Idlib province. People waiting in the Ramousah garage heard the blast and said they feared revenge attacks by pro-government forces. They circulated a statement on social media imploring ""international organizations"" to intervene so the situation did not escalate. The evacuation deal is one of several over recent months that has seen President Bashar al-Assads government take back control of areas long besieged by his forces and their allies. The deals are unpopular with the Syrian opposition who say they amount to forced displacement of Assads opponents from Syrias main urban centers in the west of the country. They are also causing demographic changes because those who are displaced are usually Sunni Muslims like most of the opposition. Assad is from the minority Alawite sect and is supported by Shia regional allies. It was unclear who carried out Saturdays bombing attack. The exact reasons for the delay in completing the evacuation deal were also unclear. The Observatory said the delay was caused by the fact that rebels from Zabadani another town near Damascus included in the deal had not yet been granted safe passage out. FORCED DISPLACEMENT A pro-opposition activist said insurgents blamed the delay partly on the fact that a smaller number of pro-government fighters had left the Shia villages than was agreed. Earlier on Saturday at the transit point where the buses from al-Foua and Kefraya were waiting one resident said he was not yet sure where he would live. ""After Aleppo Ill see what the rest of the group is doing if there are any preparations. My house land and belongings are all in al-Foua"" Mehdi Tahhan said. A Madaya resident speaking from the bus garage inside Aleppo said people had been waiting there since late on Friday and were not being allowed to leave. ""Theres no drinking water or food. The bus garage is small so theres not much space to move around"" Ahmed 24 said. ""Were sad and angry about what has happened"" he said. Many people felt that they had been forced to leave"" he said. ""There was no other choice in the end - we were besieged inside a small area in Madaya."" Other evacuation deals in recent months have included areas of Aleppo and a district in the city of Homs. Syrias population is mostly Sunni. Assads Alawite religious minority is often considered an offshoot of Shia Islam. He has been backed militarily by Russia and by Shia fighters from Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah group in Syrias six-year-old conflict. Assad has the military advantage over rebels in the west thanks to Russias intervention in 2015 although the insurgents are still fighting back and have made gains in some areas."

__label__1	__topic__2 Factbox: Congress debates Obamas plan for Syria strikes September 9 2013 Factbox: Congress debates Obamas plan for Syria strikes. President Barack Obamas request for congressional authorization for military strikes against Syria is set to dominate the Congress this week and next with the outcome in doubt. Obama is seeking backing for the strikes in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack near Damascus on August 21. Washington blames the Syrian government for the attack which it says kills more than 1400 people. Here are the important steps in Congress: - On Monday Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid began moving to limit debate on the motion to proceed to a resolution authorizing the use of military force. The motion to proceed is the mechanism for bringing legislation before the full Senate. It is not yet clear whether opponents will allow a simple majority vote on this procedural step or insist on a more difficult 60-vote majority in the 100-member chamber in which Obamas Democrats control 54 seats. This first test vote is now set for Wednesday. - On Monday evening many members of Congress will receive a classified briefing from administration and military officials. For scores of lawmakers this will be their first inside look at the Syria situation. - Reid in consultation with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell will likely decide how many and which amendments to the bill will be debated on the Senate floor. - Obama is due to lunch on Tuesday with Senate Democrats in an attempt to sway enough of them to support a military strike. - He then plans a speech to the nation on Tuesday night which could be a defining moment. Many undecided members of the Senate and House are likely to make up their minds on how they will vote after that speech and into Wednesday. - If the Senate votes to debate the resolution itself opponents could erect another procedural hurdle that would require 60 votes to limit this debate. Should those votes prove necessary and if Reid succeeds in rounding them up a vote on passing the Syria resolution could come on Thursday or Friday. A simple majority vote in favor of the bill would send it to the House for consideration. - The House could simply vote for or against the Senate-passed bill. Or it could amend the bill pass it and send it back to the Senate for approval. Another option though one that seems less likely now is for a House committee to write its own bill for debate in the 435-member House. In any event it could be next week before the full House takes action. Reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by David Brunnstrom Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes on Al-Shaara a town held by the Islamic State (IS) group in Deir Ezzor province were suspected to have been carried out by either Russian or Syrian government planes. The death toll is likely to rise due to the serious condition of some of the wounded Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. Residents from nearby villages typically flock to the Al-Shaara market to do their shopping Abdel Rahman said. Heavy air strikes hit IS group -held areas in and outside the divided city of Deir Ezzor from early Monday he said. IS controls more than 60 percent of Deir Ezzor city the capital of the oil-rich province of the same name most of which has been in its hands since 2013. The Observatory relies on a network of sources inside Syria to gather its information on the five-year-old conflict which has killed more than 280000 people and displaced millions. It says it determines whether strikes were carried out by Syrian Russian or US-led coalition aircraft based on the location of the raids flight patterns and the types of planes and munitions involved. Regime air strikes killed at least 15 civilians in the IS-held area of Boleel outside Deir Ezzor city on Friday according to the monitor.

__label__1	"__topic__2 Students among scores dead as raids hit Syria school Date of publication 26 October 2016 Warplanes either Russia or Syrian carried out six strikes in the village of Hass including on a school complex a monitor has said. Airstrikes on Syrias rebel-held Idlib province hit a school and the surrounding area on Wednesday killing at least 26 civilians including many children a monitor and activists said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said ""warplanes either Russia or Syrian carried out six strikes"" in the village of Hass including on a school complex. The Britain-based Observatory which monitors Syrias five-year conflict said at least 11 children were among the 26 civilians killed. A complex of 3 schools was targeted in by many airstrikes including a double tap. Initial reports of 20+ killed & many injured. The White Helmets civil defence group released pictures of four rescue workers clambering over a mound of rubble in search of survivors after what it said was a ""double-tap"" strike on the school. The raids hit Hass around 1130 am (0830 GMT) an activist with the opposition Idlib Media Centre told AFP. ""One rocket hit the entrance of the school as students were leaving to go home after the school administration decided to end classes for the day because of the raids"" the activist said speaking on condition of anonymity. Other activists from the province circulated a photograph on social media of a childs arm seared off above the elbow still clutching the strap of a dusty black rucksack. Shaky video footage depicted rescue workers sprinting towards the site of the raids and pulling a frail elderly man out of a collapsed building. The authenticity of the pictures and footage could not be independently verified. Syrian government forces and their Russian ally have been criticised by rights groups for indiscriminate attacks on civilian infrastructure. Intentional attack A leading opposition group condemned the raids. The Istanbul-based National Coalition said Russian and regime warplanes ""targeted children in their schools deliberately and intentionally hitting civilians with high-explosive material."" Idlib province is controlled by the Army of Conquest an alliance of rebel groups and extremists including the Fateh al-Sham Front which changed its name from al-Nusra Front after breaking off ties with al-Qaeda earlier this year. Syrian and Russian warplanes regularly bomb Idlib but airstrikes have intensified in recent weeks according to the Observatory. Seven days of airstrikes across the northwestern province had left more than 75 civilians dead and another 150 wounded it said. Syrias conflict erupted in March 2011 with protests calling for the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad. But it has since evolved into a multi-front war pitting extremists rebels government forces and Kurdish militia against each other. More than 300000 people have been killed and millions forced to flee their homes. 	 	 Read Also"

The Assad regime committed a horrific massacre in the village of al-Bureij northeast of Aleppo where 18 civilians were killed and dozens wounded in a barrel bomb attack that targeted the town. Twenty-six civilians were also killed yesterday when Assads air force pounded the neighborhood of Al-Maghayer in Aleppo killing 26 civilians mostly children and women. The Syrian Coalition extends condolences to families of the victims and wishes the wounded speedy recovery praising the steadfastness of the people of Aleppo and stressing its solidarity with them. Despite all the odds the Syrian people will not hesitate to uphold the rights to freedom justice and dignity. The Syrians belief their goals will grow even stronger inspired by the determination of those who sacrificed their lives to continue the revolution until victory is achieved. The Syrian Coalition emphasizes that the Assad regimes continued atrocities lay responsibility on the international community to protect Syrian civilians through the imposition of a safe areas to rein in Assads air force. All kinds of legal recognition of the Assad regime must be withdrawn as it would not have committed all these atrocities had it not been for its confidence of the inaction of the international community.

UNICEF Director Alan Lane said that six teachers also died in the attacks while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that 35 people in total had died. ""This is a tragedy. It is an outrage. And if deliberate it is a war crime"" Lane said in a statement. ""This latest atrocity may be the deadliest attack on a school sincethe war began more than five years ago."" ""When will the worlds revulsion at such barbarity be matched by insistence that this must stop?"" added the UNICEF director.

Activists posted pictures of bodies of small children and schoolbags covered with blood allegedly as a result of the bombing.

A monitoring group said a child was also among at least eight people killed in government shelling on the rebel-held town of Douma outside Damascus. ""Three children were killed and 14 students were injured in a terrorist rocket attack on the national school in the Shahba neighbourhood of Aleppo"" state news agency SANA reported. The neighbourhood is in the western outskirts of the city which has been roughly divided since mid-2012 when rebels seized its eastern half. Rebels regularly fire crude homemade rockets into the west of the city often killing civilians. Government forces backed by ally Russia have waged an aerial and ground assault since late September to recapture eastern Aleppo killing hundreds of civilians and destroying infrastructure including hospitals. The deaths came a day after the UN childrens agency UNICEF said 22 children had been killed along with six teachers in air strikes on a school in rebel-held Idlib province. The strikes carried out by either Russian or Syrian warplanes according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights hit the village of Hass prompting outrage from UNICEF director Anthony Lake. ""This is a tragedy. It is an outrage. And if deliberate it is a war crime"" he said adding that the school complex had been hit repeatedly. Outside Damascus meanwhile at least eight people were killed on Thursday in government shelling on Douma in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta region the British-based Observatory said. Douma is regularly targeted by government fire and in recent months regime forces have waged an offensive in the area which has also been under siege since 2013.

Bashar Assads forces with assistance from Russian airstrikes is continuing its siege of opposition groups in Aleppo and is attempting to cut a road leading into the opposition-held section of the city while the groups continue to wage fierce battles despite intensified airstrikes some of which have reportedly targeted civilians. The groups had previously launched an attack against regime positions in the historic center of Aleppo on Monday in response to an offensive on Castello Road which is used for supplies and access severing opposition-held areas under siege where at least 250000 people live. Regime airstrikes killed 20 civilians on Monday in the Bab al-Maqam neighborhood of Aleppo Syria Live Network (SLN) reported. One civilian was killed and many others were injured by a regime barrel bomb dropped on al-Jalloum. Many civilians were wounded in the attacks on the al-Ansari neighborhood. Inflicting heavy casualties in the battlefield the regime also intensified its aerial artillery and missile bombardment on the neighborhoods of Bab Qensrin al-Kallaseh Bab al-Hadid and Bab al-Nasr in Aleppos old city. Eyewitnesses said that the regime used cluster bombs and vacuum bombs in the airstrikes. Elsewhere jets believed to be Russian or Syrian also struck a fuel market in a town in the northwestern province of Idlib killing 18 people and injuring scores more according to a local rescue worker near the site. An airstrike hit a local field hospital in the town of Ahsem in Idlib province killing three people including a child an international charity and an aid worker said. Early on Monday more than 300 shells fired by opposition groups hit western regime-held neighborhoods of Aleppo. The assault was ""a response to the [government] attempts to advance"" Zakaria Malahifji of the Aleppo-based Fastaqim opposition group told Reuters. He said insurgents had already made gains and that much of the fighting was taking place in Aleppos ancient old city a renowned UNESCO World Heritage site now largely in ruins. A witness reported fierce close-range clashes near the historic citadel where the opposition killed at least 20 army troops when they blew up a tunnel they dug underneath a regime post. The city Syrias largest before the war has been a main battleground in the countrys five-year war and has seen an escalation of fighting after peace talks and a fragile ceasefire broke down earlier this year. Its capture would be a strategic prize for the Assad regime which controls the major population centers in western Syria apart from opposition-held areas of Aleppo and the city of Idlib. Opposition also control pockets of territory elsewhere in western Syria. Early on Monday more than 300 shells fired by opposition groups hit western regime-held neighborhoods in Aleppo killing five people and wounding dozens more observers said. A U.N. spokeswoman said that intensified fighting between Syrian government forces and rebels in contested Aleppo has completely cut off the only road allowing access for humanitarian aid deliveries into the rebel-held part of the city. Alessandra Vellucci said on Tuesday that the Castello Road considered the only access in and out of eastern Aleppo has been rendered ""impassable"" since hostilities there worsened last week. Vellucci said the U.N. estimates that 300000 people depend on the road which allows for the flow of supplies goods and civilians into the area. She said the U.N. continues to receive ""distressing reports of aerial bombardment and shelling on civilian locations in both western and eastern Aleppo."" She called on all sides to protect civilians and ease access for humanitarian access to all.

Reporters Without Borders counted 66 journalists killed in 2014 along with 119 were kidnapped and 178 were imprisoned. According to a report by New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists at least 84 journalists have been killed since the fighting began in 2011."

The attack came as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that troops had executed 48 people earlier this week in a northern village among them 10 children. ""The explosion that hit the town of Qardaha... was caused by a suicide bomber driving a car along with another person"" said the Observatory adding that the passenger likely an accomplice also died in the blast. ""Two women and two soldiers were killed in the attack"" said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. Earlier state television had reported the blast but did not specify the nature of the attack. The attack the first explosion to hit the heart of the western town since the outbreak of Syrias civil war in 2011 took place in the parking of Qardaha hospital. The outskirts of Qardaha have previously come under rocket fire while Latakia province - where the town is located - has seen several rounds of heavy fighting. A mausoleum containing the graves of President Bashar al-Assads father and predecessor Hafez and brother Bassil is located in Qardaha. The clan has ruled Syria with an iron fist for more than 40 years. Syrias war began in March 2011 as a pro-democracy revolt seeking Assads ouster. It morphed into a conflict after the regime unleashed a brutal crackdown on dissent. Meanwhile the Observatory said 10 children and 13 rebels were among 48 people executed by government forces in the northern village of Rityan earlier this week. The killings took place after troops entered the town Tuesday during an offensive aimed at cutting rebel supply lines to the Turkish border. Abdel Rahman said all the dead were from six families. ""There was no resistance except in one house where a rebel opened fire at troops before being executed along with his family."" The brief seizure of Rityan was part of an abortive army offensive this week to encircle the rebel-held east of Aleppo and relieve two besieged Shiite villages to its north. By Friday all but one of the villages taken by government forces had been recaptured by the rebels who include fighters from Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front. The heavy fighting claimed the lives of 129 loyalists and 116 rebels including an Al-Nusra commander according to an Observatory toll. While the ground offensive failed warplanes kept pounding rebel areas of Aleppo city and other parts of the country. On Saturday two women and two children were among eight people killed when a barrel bomb hit a building in an opposition-held area of Aleppo city once Syrias commercial capital. Six people were also reported killed in rebel shelling of regime-held areas of the city. The air force also killed at least 10 people in rebel areas east of Damascus Saturday the Observatory said. According to the group they were the latest of more than 7000 people killed across Syria since the UN Security Council passed a resolution last year ordering an end to sieges and indiscriminate use of weapons in populated areas. The Observatory ""has documented the killing of 5812 civilians including 1733 children 969 women and 3110 men in barrel bombings and (other) air raids"" over the past year. Meanwhile rebel fire on regime-held areas killed 1102 people said the Observatory adding that 234 of them were children. And 313 people died in areas under army siege in the past year as a result of food and medical shortages despite the fact that the resolution also ordered the lifting of sieges."

Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Bashar al-Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests - which erupted as part of the ""Arab Spring"" uprisings - with unexpected ferocity and disproportionate force. Since then more than a quarter of a million people have been killed - and more than 10 million displaced - throughout the war-battered country according to the UN.

International coalition planes targeted water wells where a group of civilians were gathered in the north of Raqqa city killing at least 18 civilians observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. The Britain-based group said four children were among the dead. The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters broke into Raqqa in June and has since wrested 90 per cent of the city from Daesh. But activists say coalition strikes in support of the operation have killed hundreds of civilians and caused enormous damage. The coalitions spokesman Colonel Ryan Dillon said it does everything within its power to limit harm to non-combatants and civilian infrastructure. He said rigorous standards were applied to coalition targeting and extraordinary efforts taken to avoid civilian deaths. The coalition conducts a detailed assessment of each and every allegation of possible civilian casualties and we will do so for this allegation as well he added in an e-mail to AFP. In late September the coalition acknowledged the deaths of 735 civilians in its strikes on Syria and Iraq since 2014. But activists say the toll is much higher. Raqqa has faced water shortages for months because of damage to pipelines caused by suspected coalition strikes. Even in the early days of the Raqqa assault residents said they feared being caught in air strikes or shelling when they ventured to wells or the Euphrates River that runs south of the city to draw water.

Tags Castello road Syria Syrian regime UN siege Aleppo al-Nusra Front Ahrar al-Sham At least 29 Syrian rebels were killed in clashes with regime troops overnight during a failed bid to reopen the oppositions key supply route into Aleppo city. The fighters from the Faylaq al-Sham Islamist faction and al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front were killed trying to reopen the Castello Road which regime forces effectively severed on Thursday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. The road was the only remaining supply route into the opposition-held east of Aleppo city which has been divided between government and rebel control since mid-2012. Government forces effectively severed the route on Thursday when they seized a hilltop within firing range of the Castello Road. The Observatory said there were deaths among government forces in the overnight fighting but had no immediate toll. ""The attack has ended and the road remains completely closed"" said Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman. Civilians face food shortages Syrian rebel forces are preparing for a major battle in Aleppo [Anadolu] Residents in Aleppo described shortages of basic goods after government troops advanced within firing range of the key Castello Road supply route. ""For two days the situation was calm I went to the market and I filled up my motorbike with gasoline. Today I couldnt even find a single tomato"" said Bilal Qaterji a local textile factory employee. ""Theres not a drop of fuel left because the Castello Road has been cut"" he told AFP. Residents in eastern Aleppo said they feared ongoing shortages if the Castello Road remained closed. ""I worry that the Castello Road will be cut for a long time it will lead to shortages of bread and other necessities"" said Ahmed Kanjou an unemployed father of four. Residents said prices were already rising and many were bracing for the possibility of a lengthy siege. Syrias government has been accused of using siege tactics to pressure rebel forces and the UN says nearly 600000 Syrians live in besieged areas most surrounded by government forces although rebels also use the method. Activists and rights groups including Doctors Without Borders [MSF] have reported deaths from starvation in some besieged areas. The Castello Road wraps around Aleppos eastern and northern edges and leads into rebel-controlled territory north of the battered city. President Bashar al-Assads forces have been trying to cut the route for more than two years and their Thursday advance brought them the closest so far to achieving that goal.

__label__1	__topic__2 Syrian army Islamic State clash near army airport: monitor July 18 2014 Syrian army Islamic State clash near army airport: monitor. Syrian soldiers clashed with Islamic State militants outside a government-controlled army airport on Friday a British-based monitoring group said part of a major escalation of fighting between the al Qaeda offshoot and the military. The hardline Sunni militants have gained ground in Syria over the past five weeks bolstered by equipment seized in a lightning offensive last month in neighbouring Iraq. On Thursday the group seized the Shaar oilfield east of the central city of Homs in what the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said was one of its bloodiest clashes with President Bashar al-Assads forces. On Friday the death toll from the raid rose to 115 the Observatory said. The fate of 250 others was unknown it said. A video posted online on Thursday purportedly of the battle site showed armed men pacing through a barren desert space speaking in Arabic and German as they reviewed what appeared to be more than 50 bodies many with gunshot wounds to the head chest and legs. Some of the bodies appeared to be young men. Here lie two pigs said one of the men speaking German. At least two multiple-rocket launchers and other military vehicles were visible. The Observatory an anti-Assad group which tracks the violence through a network of contacts in Syria said the government had sent reinforcements backed by helicopters to the nearby Hajjar oil field. In Raqqa province which borders Turkey a woman - sentenced to death for adultery by the Islamic State - was stoned to death the Observatory said. The report could not immediately be corroborated. MILITARY AIRPORT On Friday fighting also broke out between Islamic State militants and government forces at the army airport in Deir al-Zor one of the last major strategic locations in Deir al-Zor province not under the control of the Islamic State. The Syrian army responded to the militants offensive by bombing areas around the airport which supplies its forces in the east of the country the Observatory said. There were no details of casualties. The fighting was just a few hundred metres (yards) from the airport the Observatorys director Rami Abdurrahman said noting that it would be tough for the Islamic State to overcome government forces there. The Islamic State expelled rival rebels from Deir al-Zor city on Monday tightening its hold on the eastern province bordering Iraq. [ID:nL6N0PP2YH] Capturing most of Deir al-Zor province has helped the Islamic State link up territorial gains across Syria and Iraq where it seized the northern city of Mosul in June. Last month it also declared an Islamic caliphate in territory it controls in both countries. The group previously known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant follows al Qaedas hardline ideology but draws strength from foreign fighters many with experience in Iraq.

Hours of air strikes and shelling on Saturday struck Jayrud 60 kilometres (35 miles) northeast of Damascus according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said two medics were among the dead as well as women and children. One of those killed was Amjad al-Danaf head of Jayruds medical centre. Activists mourned him online and said he was killed in an air raid as he was trying to treat residents wounded in the attacks. The bombardment - the first on Jayrud in at least two years - began after Syrias armed forces said Islamist militants killed a government pilot when he was forced to eject from his plane on Friday. In a statement the military had pledged that the attack on its pilot ""will not go unpunished"". Early Sunday Abdel Rahman said prominent figures in Jayrud had reached an agreement with government officials that rebel fighters would leave the town and hand over the pilots body in exchange for a halt to the shelling. A Facebook page run by Jayrud activists that publishes news about the town said rebels began withdrawing from their bases around the town overnight. Anti-regime factions in Jayrud include the Saudi-backed Jaish al-Islam (Army of Islam) the hardline Ahrar al-Sham and Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front. A truce between the regime and local representatives had kept the town calm for over two years. Dozens of similar agreements have been brokered among the myriad of armed groups fighting in Syrias complex war. But a broader ceasefire between government forces and non-jihadist rebels brokered by the United States and Russia in February has been repeatedly violated by both sides. More than 280000 people have been killed and millions have been displaces since Syrias conflict broke out in March 2011."

Turkish artillery and coalition jets hit 33 weapons emplacements including Katyusha rockets which were reportedly preparing to attack Turkey security sources said on Monday on the condition of anonymity due to restrictions on speaking with the media. During Sundays operation 23 DAESH terrorists were killed and three buildings one defensive position and an anti-tank rocket launcher were destroyed in northern Syria the sources said. The southeastern province of Kilis has faced a spate of cross-border rocket attacks from DAESH in recent months. Kilis has been under indiscriminate rocket attacks from neighboring Syria since mid-January. Twenty people in Kilis have been killed and almost 70 others wounded by rockets that fell in the city. Syrian Arab forces have also taken territory formerly held by DAESH in a bid to capture a strategic hub linking the terrorist group with the Turkish border. The Peoples Protection Units- (YPG) dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have seized 3 kilometers of territory to the northeast of the northern city of Manbij plus 6 kilometers to the south the Pentagon said on June 9. Recognizing DAESH as a terrorist organization on Oct. 10 2013 in an official declaration Turkey continues to fight DAESH both with military precautions along the Syrian border and with extensive investigations in the country to cut off supply and recruitment routes.

They said several raids overnight hit Babeska a village in Idlib province that has become a haven for several moderate Free Syrian Army (FSA) groups. A tripartite mechanism was established in February by Turkey Russia and Iran to monitor the cease-fire in Syria. Opposition forces say Russia has failed to put pressure on the Assad regime to ensure the ceasefire holds. The village also houses hundreds of families and fighters from the Damascus suburb of Daraya which was evacuated by opposition forces and surrendered to Assad regime control last year. War jets also believed to be Russian also struck Urum al Kubra town in opposition-held western Aleppo countryside where five civilians were killed in an area that witnessed fighting between the opposition and the Assad regime opposition said.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assads forces bombarded rebel-held suburbs of Damascus on Thursday activists said keeping up pressure on the besieged region a day after the opposition accused the army of gassing hundreds in a chemical weapons attack. Rockets fired from multiple launchers and heavy mortar rounds hit the neighborhoods of Jobar and Zamalka which are on the eastern outskirts of the capital. Between 500 and 1300 people died on Wednesday from chemical weapons attacks in those areas which are part of what is known as the Ghouta the activists said. Rockets also hit the nearby district of Qaboun to the north where rebel fighters have repelled attempts by loyalist forces to overrun the area and the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp area to the south the activists added. Speaking from Ghouta activist Khaled Amer said explosions from rockets hitting Zamalka were being heard. In Jobar a Damascus neighborhood only 3 km (2 miles) from the historic center of the ancient capital explosions were heard at an army fortification and another compound housing tanks apparently from a rebel attack on the facilities. Fadi al-Shami of the Tarhrir al-Sham Brigade which operates in the eastern Ghouta region said scattered fighting was taking place along the Jobar-Zamalka axis and that opposition forces have moved closer to loyalist lines partly to be in safer positions in case of another chemical attack.

The group said at least 127 people including 30 children have been killed by air strikes and shelling since the Syrian army backed by Russian jets began an offensive nearly two weeks ago to take the besieged rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area. Eastern Ghouta is one of several ""de-escalation"" zones across western Syria where Russia has brokered deals to ease the fighting between rebels and President Bashar Assads government. A Reuters witness said there had been drones in the sky since Sunday morning and warplanes had heavily bombarded the towns of Mesraba and Harasta. Heavy shelling also hit Eastern Ghouta and dozens had been injured. Assads forces have besieged Eastern Ghouta since 2012 and the area is suffering a humanitarian crisis. Ghouta residents are so short of food that they are eating trash fainting from hunger and forcing their children to eat on alternate days the UN World Food Programme said in a report this week. The opposition Eastern Ghouta Damascus Countryside local council said this week the escalating bombardment was forcing people to seek shelter in unsuitable and unsanitary places which it feared could lead to disease outbreaks. A number of shells from the rebel enclave have hit government-held Damascus in the past two weeks. Syrias six-year-old civil war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced millions to flee in the worst refugee crisis since World War II. UN-backed peace negotiations are due to begin in Geneva on November 28. Several previous rounds of Geneva talks have failed to agree a political transition for Syria or a way to stop the violence. Yahya Aridi spokesman for the Syrian opposition Geneva delegation said on Sunday it was now time for the Syrian government and the opposition to ""get to the table and start talking about transition from dictatorship to freedom"" in Geneva."

The death toll from twin the terrorist ugly explosions in the Syrian province of Homs rose to 32 and more than 115 wounded persons most of them children and several sustaining critical injuries. The death toll from twin the terrorist ugly explosions in the Syrian province of Homs rose to 32 and more than 115 wounded persons most of them children and several sustaining critical injuries. Two terrorist bombings hit an area near a school compound in Ikrima neighborhood in Homs city on Wednesday. A source in the central province said that terrorists detonated up a car bomb in front of the New Ikrima School and only a few minutes later a suicide bomber blew himself up in front of Ikrima al-Makhzoumi School. The attacks took place at the time when students were leaving school to inflict maximum casualties. The source pointed out that the car bomb was made up of three gas cylinders each packed with 7 kg of C4 explosives and concealed in a Mazda. Prime Minister Dr. Wael al-Halqi condemned the twin terrorist blasts that rocked Homs city on Wednesday. These terrorist acts in which terrorists have taken their hatred out on our schoolchildren are meant to discourage Syrias children from pursuing knowledge he told SANA. The terrorist groups have been taken aghast by the Syrian armys military successes the Premier said which accounts for their resort to these cowardly acts. Al-Halqi said these terrorist acts will make us even stronger and more determined to restore security and stability all over Syria. In the same context Regional leadership of al-Baath Arab Socialist Part strongly condemned the twin terrorist explosions that targeted the students. In a statement the Partys leadership said that the terrorist twin explosions reveal again the brutality of terrorists and their hatred against the Syrian citizens who achieved a lot of victories over terrorism. Homs governor Talal al-Barazi said targeting safe children in their schools is an act of cowardice and a desperate attempt to undermine the steadfastness of Syria and reverse the state of security and stability in Homs province. Al-Barazi whose comments came during a visit he paid to the hospitals where the injured from Wednesday twin terrorist bombings lay said the internal security forces have facilitated the movement of ambulances which rushed to the site of the explosion to evacuate the victims and rescue the wounded. Director of Homs Health Directorate Dr. Hassan al-Jundi said the health sector is on high alert to take all necessary measures under these extraordinary circumstances. The twin terrorist bombings have taken the lives of scores most of them schoolchildren he added indicating that the injuries range in severity from moderate to severe.

Hizballah fighters backed by Syrian and Iranian forces have pushed the Nusra Front and from the town of Deir al-Adas reports say in a major offensive in the Daraa governorate. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Deir al-Adas was taken on Tuesday after two days of fierce fighting between regime elements and rebels including members of Nusra al-Qaedas affiliate in Syria and fighters from the Free Syrian Army. The offensive is part of the operation launched on Sunday to seize areas at the intersection point of the three Syrian governorates of Rif Dimashq Daraa and Quneitra near the disputed Golan Heights. The observatory group said 20 opposition fighters were killed in the fighting including a Hizballah ambush near Deir al-Adas. The groups director Rami Abdulrahman told the AFP news agency that Hizballah was leading the attack on Deir al-Adas and its surrounding hills. Al-Araby al-Jadeed cannot independently verify the reports. Restoring security The official Syrian news agency Sana quoted a military source on Wednesday as saying the army was able to ""restore security"" to Sanei Tal al-Hawa and Tal-Arous in the southwestern countryside of Damascus Tal Meri west of Damascus and al-Danaji and Tal Antar near Deir al-Adas. The opposition Local Coordination Committee of Deir al-Adas said heavy shelling had forced the Free Syrian Army from the town which was now ""in range of their firepower"". Ayman al-Aasmi a member of the FSA southern front command claimed that Hizballah was trying to set up a permanent base in north Daraa to link its positions in southern Lebanon through the hills of Mount Hermon. ""The issue is not just about retaking some towns and hills"" he said. ""Hizballah pushed large forces into the battle mostly made up of Lebanese and Iraqi militias in light of the regime forces collapse in the Daraa governorate as a result of losses in battles with opposition forces defections or redeployment into the hot spots in other governorates.""

Syrian children receive treatment following a suspected toxic gas attack in Khan Shaykhun a rebel-held town in the northwestern Syrian Idlib province on April 4 2017. (TRT World and Agencies) International leaders have condemned the alleged chemical attacks which killed at least 58 people including 11 children in Syrias Idlib province on Tuesday. Syrian regime jets pounded the town of Khan Shaykhun. Medics attending the victims said they bore the signs of a gas attack. The war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said those killed had died from suffocation and the effects of a toxic gas. The weapons used caused many people to choke or faint and some had foam coming out of their mouths SOHR said citing medical sources who described the air strikes as a ""toxic gas attack."" Fifteen victims mostly women and children were brought to Turkey for treatment. International condemnation Turkeys Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey condemns the suspected chemical attack describing it as a crime against humanity. He said the attack could derail the process of Syrian peace talks being held in Astana Kazakhstan. EUs diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini said the regime of Bashar al Assad bears ""primary responsibility"" for the attack. ""Today the news is awful"" Mogherini said in an interview with media organisations in Brussels on the sidelines of a EU-UN conference that was meant to focus on the post-conflict situation in Syria. French President Francois Hollande accused Assad regime of responsibility for a ""massacre"". ""Once again the Syrian regime will deny the evidence of its responsibility for this massacre"" Hollande said in a statement. The White House also blamed the attack on the regime saying the incident was ""reprehensible and cannot be ignored by the civilised world."" ""These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the last administrations weakness and irresolution"" White House spokesman Sean Spicer told a briefing. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson also condemned the attack saying those responsible should be ""held to account."" Drawing criticism from around the world Idlib was also trending globally on social media site Twitter. Russia denies involvement Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed Tuesdays attack Turkish presidential sources said. ""President Erdogan touched on the use of chemical weapons against civilians in Idlib. President Erdogan said such inhumane attacks are unacceptable"" a statement from top residential sources said. However Russia has categorically denied any involvement.

__label__1	__topic__2 Death toll mounts after bomb blast on Aleppo evacuee bus convoy Saturday 15 April 2017 Death toll mounts after bomb blast on Aleppo evacuee bus convoy. A bomb blast hit a bus convoy waiting to enter Aleppo on Saturday killing at least 100 and wounding hundreds more after an evacuation deal between Syrias warring sides halted and stranded thousands at two transit points on the city outskirts. Images posted by the outlets showed bodies lying next to charred buses with their windows blown out and flaming vehicles belching out thick black smoke. British-based monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights counted 24 dead and dozens more wounded. The blast hit buses in the Rashidin area on Aleppos outskirts which had been waiting to cross from rebel-held territory into the government-controlled city itself carrying people evacuated from two Shiite villages on Friday. The residents alongside hundreds of pro-government fighters had left the two rebel-besieged villages in northwest Idlib province under a deal where in exchange hundreds of Sunni insurgents and their families moved out of a government-besieged area near Damascus. But a delay in the agreement had left all those evacuated stuck at two transit points on Aleppos outskirts since late on Friday. Residents of al-Foua and Kefraya the Shiite villages were waiting in the Rashidin area. The rebels and residents of Madaya near Damascus were waiting at the government-held Ramousah bus garage a few miles away. They were to be transported to Idlib province which the armed opposition controls. The agreement is one of several over recent months that has seen President Bashar al-Assads government take back control of areas long besieged by his forces and their allies. The Observatory said the delay was caused by the fact that rebels from Zabadani another town near Damascus included in the deal had not yet been granted safe passage out. A pro-opposition activist said insurgents blamed the delay partly on the fact that a smaller number of pro-government fighters had left the Shiite villages than was agreed. Earlier on Saturday at the transit point where the buses from al-Foua and Kefraya were waiting one resident said he was not yet sure where he would live. After Aleppo Ill see what the rest of the group is doing if there are any preparations. My house land and belongings are all in al-Foua Mehdi Tahhan said. We had no choice A Madaya resident speaking from the bus garage inside Aleppo said people had been waiting there since late on Friday and were not being allowed to leave. Theres no drinking water or food. The bus garage is small so theres not much space to move around Ahmed 24 said. Were sad and angry about what has happened he said. Many people felt that they had been forced to leave he said. There was no other choice in the end - we were besieged inside a small area in Madaya. Syrias opposition says the evacuation deals which include areas of Aleppo and a district in the city of Homs amount to forced displacement of Assads opponents from Syrias main urban centers in the west of the country. The agreements are also causing demographic changes they say because those who are displaced are mostly Sunni Muslims. Syrias population is mostly Sunni. Assad is from the Alawite religious minority often considered an offshoot of Shiite Islam. He has been backed militarily by Russia and by Shiite fighters from Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah group in Syrias six-year-old conflict. Assad has the military advantage over rebels in the west thanks to Russias intervention in 2015 although the insurgents are still fighting back and have made gains in some areas.

Syrian tanks shelled the central city of Hama Monday killing four civilians residents said a day after rights groups said security forces killed 80 there in one of the bloodiest days of the five-month-old uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Here are some details about the city which was the site of a massacre in 1982: * 1982: - In the late 1970s and early 1980s Syrias Muslim Brotherhood sought to destabilize and unseat President Hafez al-Assad and his government through political assassinations and urban guerilla warfare. In February 1982 the Muslim Brotherhood ambushed government forces searching for dissidents in Hama. - Syrian government forces attacked the city razing the old quarters of Hama to crush the armed uprising by Brotherhood fighters who had taken refuge there. - Estimates of the death toll in the three weeks of operations in Hama vary from 10000 to more than 30000 out of a population of 350000. Syria then imprisoned much of the membership of the local Islamist group. - Syrian human rights groups said that women children and the elderly were among those killed in the crackdown and thousands were forced to flee the city. * 2011: - In June activists said Syrian forces killed at least 60 protesters in the city. Residents said security forces and snipers had fired on crowds of demonstrators. - Assad sacked the governor of Hama province on July 2 a day after tens of thousands of protesters massed in the provincial capital to demand the Syrian leader step down. - The demonstration in Hama was part of nationwide protests which activists said were some of the biggest since the uprising against Assads rule erupted in mid-March. - In a symbolic show of solidarity U.S. ambassador Robert Ford and French ambassador Eric Chevallier visited Hama on July 8 to put pressure on Assad not to crush the protest. Syria condemned the action and summoned them to Damascus on July 10. - Ford had only arrived in Damascus in January. After he posted a letter on the embassys Facebook page a mob stormed the embassy compound July 11 tearing down plaques. - On July 31 a tank-backed assault killed at least 80 people in Hama rights groups said. The state news agency said the military was purging armed groups that were terrorizing citizens. Monday tanks shelled a northeastern district of Hama killing four more civilians two residents said. * ABOUT HAMA: - Hama has been settled as far back as the Bronze Age and Iron Age. Famous for its citadel and its ancient Norias (waterwheels) the younger Assad and his government has sought to promote the city as a tourist destination. - Hama Syrias fourth biggest city has a mostly Sunni Muslim population of 700000. It lies about 210 km (131 miles) north of Damascus.

__label__0	"__topic__2 At least 17 dead as suicide bombings hit Damascus 3 Oct 2017 At least 17 people were killed and many more injured on Monday by suicide bombings that targeted a police station in the Midan neighbourhood of Damascus the capital of Syria. Several suicide bombers believed to have been three detonated themselves in front of and inside the police station according to authorities. Local police officers learned that one of the bombers used a hand grenade to attack the police station from a viaduct before he detonated his explosive device at about 1330 on the viaduct which runs parallel to the police station. ""Previously the attacker whose identity was unknown attacked us. The terrorists outside the police station launched the attack from the viaduct. Police officers and the army unit together resisted and foiled the attack"" said Tarek a police officer. Afterward another bomber detonated his explosive device at the gate of the police station while a third bomber entered the police station and detonated his explosive device after being surrounded by police officers and an army unit. The Syrian regimes Interior Minister Mohammed Shaar told reporters that one of the attackers had managed to enter the police station and reach the first floor of the building. Daesh said three of its fighters carried out an attack on a Damascus police station on Monday. In a statement distributed on a Daesh channel via the Telegram messaging service on Tuesday the group said two of the fighters fired shots in the station before blowing themselves up. The third blew himself up later as ""reinforcements"" arrived. Local state television showed images of damage from inside the building with a black police uniform shirt covered in dust lying in the rubble of partially collapsed walls. Policemen carried one body away from the scene wrapped inside a white tarpaulin. The same police station in Midan was targeted last December when a seven-year-old female suicide bomber blew herself up inside the station. Local reactions According to a witness because the explosion occurred during working hours and the proximity of the police station to the old city of Damascus many people were killed and nearby cars houses and buildings were all destroyed. ""This is a crime. Its a terrorist act. Nobody will accept such an act. It is tragic to see the corpses on the ground. We just began having better conditions and good supplies but what about those people who lost their cars and houses?"" said a local resident. Manal a 28-year-old teacher living in Midan said she heard at least two blasts on Monday afternoon. I was coming back from work when I heard the sound of an explosion it was around 230 pm I didnt know what it was and then there was another explosion a few minutes later and buildings shook she said. Afterwards I heard gunfire which usually happens to get people to move out of the way and clear the road so ambulances can get through to retrieve the injured she added. Damascus attacks Damascus has also been rocked by occasional bomb blasts throughout the Syrian conflict including previous attacks on Midan a middle-class residential and shopping district. In December 2016 three police officers were wounded when a seven-year-old girl walked into the neighbourhoods police station wearing an explosive belt that was remotely detonated. Rebel groups have been gradually expelled from territory in the capital they once held though they maintain a presence in a handful of positions including the Jobar neighbourhood. They also hold territory in the eastern Ghouta region outside the capital and have regularly launched rockets into the city. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since its conflict began with protests that were met with a harsh regime crackdown. Source TRTWorld and agencies"

IS in a statement published on Twitter and the messaging service Telegram said a suicide bomber detonated an explosive belt among rebels ""getting ready to fight the Islamic State"". The blast on Sunday night struck the Atme border crossing between Turkey and the northern Syrian province of Idlib according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The monitoring group said the anti-regime fighters were travelling by bus to Turkey then back into Syria towards the rebel bastion of Azaz in Aleppo province. The attack killed 32 rebels as they were entering Turkey the Britain-based Observatory said updating an earlier toll on Sunday evening of 15. Its head Rami Abdel Rahman said the toll could rise further as other fighters remained critically wounded. ISs statement said the attack left ""nearly 50"" rebels dead charging they took orders from the US-led coalition fighting IS in Iraq and Syria. IS has tried to advance on rebel territory in Aleppo province - particularly the towns of Azaz and nearby Marea - for several months. A major militant offensive in May saw IS encircle Marea but rebels pushed back the assault the following month after receiving ammunition from the coalition. More than 290000 people have been killed since Syrias conflict erupted in March 2011."

The Assad regime on Tuesday morning committed a horrific massacre in the neighborhood of Bab Alnairab killing at least 25 civilians mostly women and children. The victims were hit by airstrikes while trying to escape the eastern neighborhoods on foot. Dozens more were injured. The Syrian Coalition condemned this heinous crime holding the international community responsible as it has so far failed to take action to protect civilians or stop the onslaught on Aleppo. A total 54 civilians were killed in airstrikes by the Assad regime and Russian air forces on Aleppo and its countryside on Tuesday including 9 in the neighborhood Alsaliheen 8 in Ansari 5 in Almiyassar 3 and Karm Albeiq and 1 in each of the districts of Marjah Alizaa and Salah Addin. Regime aircraft also bombed a medicine factory in the town of Mansoura in rural Aleppo. The massacre came amid complete international silence over the brutal onslaught by the Assad regime as well as its Russian and Iranian allies on the besieged eastern Aleppo where hundreds of civilians have been killed over the past few days in deliberate bombardment on residential areas the Coalition said. The Coalition highly commended the steadfastness and courage being shown by civilians members of the civil defense and FSA fighters in Aleppo who have not spared any effort to repel the aggression by the Assad regime and Russia on their city.

Tags Syria Islamic State Group Three children were among at least 19 civilian killed in an air raid on a village held by the Islamic State group in northern Syria on Wednesday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was unclear who had carried out the strike which took place in an area where rebels backed by Turkish forces are advancing against IS. Turkey began its operation inside Syria dubbed Operation Euphrates Shield on 24 August. Ankara said it is targeting IS but also the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) which Turkey considers to be a ""terrorist"" group despite their common opposition to IS. According to the observatory the strike hit the village of Thalthana in northern Aleppo province. Thalthana lies near the key IS stronghold of Al-Bab and is just 12km southeast of IS-held Dabiq which Turkish-backed rebels have been pushing towards in recent days. Dabiq holds symbolic importance for IS because of their belief in a prophecy that states it will be the site of an apocalyptic battle between Muslims and Christians. Read Also"

Activists in Idlib province said that at least 135 civilians have been killed and hundreds more injured in airstrikes and barrel bomb attacks by the Assad regime and Russian forces on the province over the past three days. The bombardment targeted mainly public markets and residential buildings in a grave escalation in parallel with the ongoing brutal onslaught on Aleppo and its countryside. Member of the Syrian Coalitions political committee Adnan Rahmoun condemned the escalating war crimes being committed by the Russian and Assad regime forces in Idlib and Aleppo. He lamented the lack of any response by the international community which is standing idly by as the Assad regime and Russia are committing these crimes using internationally banned weapons including vacuum bombs cluster bombs and white phosphorous. Rahmoun called upon the UN Security Council and the international community to put an end to the war crimes being committed by the Assad regime and its allies and to assume their responsibilities to protect civilians. He stressed that those who keep silent over war crime are partners to their perpetrators. Idlib administration on Monday announced it was suspending its work as a result of intensive aerial bombardment by the Russian and Assad regime air forces with the exception of civil defense and medical services. Idlib University and the Department of Education in Idlib also announced they were closing down until the weekend for fear of aerial bombardment. Activists in rural Idlib said that three regime airstrikes hit a public market in the town of Sarmin on Tuesday killing 10 people including four children and two women. Russian jets launched multiple airstrikes on the main high street in the town of Maaret Alnouman killing eight people and wounding dozens more. Two more civilians were killed in regime airstrikes on the town of Maarrat Masrin. In total over 40 civilians were killed in the aerial bombardment that hit at least 11 towns and villages across Idlib on Tuesday. On Monday Russia and China vetoed a draft UN Security Council resolution calling for the imposition of a 7-day cease-fire in Aleppo so that humanitarian aid could reach the citys besieged eastern neighborhoods. The draft resolution was proposed by New Zealand Spain and Egypt. (Source: Syrian Coalitions Media Office) Twitter
__label__0	__topic__2 Syrian Coalition Urges Intl Community to Stop Crimes by Regime and Russia against Syrian Civilians Saturday 20 August 2016 Syrian Coalition Urges Intl Community to Stop Crimes by Regime and Russia against Syrian Civilians. The Syrian Coalition called on the European Union the United States and friends of the Syrian people to take immediate action in order to stop crimes carried out by the Assad regime and Russia against civilians in Syria. The Assad regime backed by Russia and allied forces continues with the campaign of terror against the Syrian people. The Coalition warned that mass killings destruction and displacement by the Assad regime and its allies undermine all chances of reaching a political settlement needed to end the suffering of the Syrian people. Activists in northern rural Homs said that the Assad regime and Russian forces have recently intensified aerial attacks on rebel-held areas. At least 13 civilians were killed and 30 others wounded in airstrikes by regime and Russian fighter jets on the town of Alghantou on Friday. Airstrikes also targeted the nearby towns of Rastan Talbeesah Ter Maaleh and Zafarana. Meanwhile Albir hospital and civilian homes in the district of Alwaer in Homs were subject to intense regime shelling on Friday with reports of civilian casualties. Activists said that the Assad regime has recently resorted to spreading rumors and misinformation to instill fear among residents of the district; a tactic Russia used in Ukraine. The Coalition stressed that the barbaric crimes death and destruction the Assad regime and its allies have been wreaking in Syria will not succeed in breaking the will of the Syrian people. The coalition warned of dire consequences as a result of the international communitys continued silence over these crimes. (Source: Syrian Coalition) Twitter

The bomber blew himself up late Monday in the village of Tall Tawil in Hasakeh province where a Kurdish party official was getting married. Rows of seats in the wedding hall were still covered in blood on Tuesday morning according to an AFP photographer at the scene. ""As the bride and groom were exchanging their vows I saw a man wearing a thick black jacket pass beside me"" a witness named Ahmad said. ""I thought he looked strange and a few seconds later there was an enormous explosion. ""People had fallen on the ground and I saw bodies torn to bits."" About 100 people were wounded according to the medical source in Hasakeh city who gave the updated toll. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a British-based monitoring group gave a slightly lower toll of 31 people killed. The Islamic State (IS) militant group said in a statement that one of its fighters had fired on a ""large gathering"" of Kurdish fighters near Hasakeh city before blowing himself up. The claim which did not mention a wedding said 40 people had been killed. Both the groom and bride were safe but the grooms father and brother were killed in the attack a relative told AFP. ""The grooms wounds are light and he and his new wife are staying at a relatives home. He doesnt want to see anyone"" he said. ""They are really shaken up by this."" The groom Zaradesht Mustafa Fatimi hails from a prominent family deeply involved in the autonomous administration run by Kurdish factions in Syrias north. According to an official from the autonomous administration Fatimi works for a local Kurdish party. The Observatory said he is also a member of the Syrian Democratic Forces an Arab-Kurdish coalition battling IS in northern Syria. Hasakeh city is almost entirely held by Kurdish forces but Syrias regime still holds some districts. The city has often been targeted by IS group militants."

Tags Syria Aleppo humanitarian aid airstrikes Four medics were killed and a nurse critically wounded when an airstrike hit a clinic in a village near Syrias second city Aleppo late Tuesday just days after dozens of aid workers were killed. The four staff of the Union of Syrian Medical Relief Organisations were in two ambulances that had been called to the clinic to take some patients for more specialised treatment the group said. The clinic in the village of Khan Tuman was completely levelled and more dead were feared to be buried under the rubble the group added. The attack comes a day after all aid convoys to Syria were temporarily suspended after a deadly airstrike on Monday killed 12 aid workers and drivers and destroyed at least 18 trucks carrying aid to Aleppo. Its ""a very very dark day... for humanitarians across the world"" Jens Laerke spokesman for the UN humanitarian aid agency OCHA said. An infuriated United Nations warned Monday nights attack could amount to a war crime. In a statement late on Tuesday the Syrian Civil Defence confirmed that Russian and regime warplanes were behind the ""deliberate attacks"" that targeted the convoy. But Russia has denied its aircraft or those of its Syrian government allies were involved in the incident. The strike appeared to deal a fatal blow to Syrias fragile week-old ceasefire. Read Also"

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes on the market in Idlib provinces Maaret al-Numan were probably carried out by regime forces. Much of Idlib province including Maaret al-Numan is controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) a group led by Al-Qaedas former Syria affiliate. Idlib is one of four so-called ""de-escalation"" zones under a deal brokered by Russia Turkey and Iran in May. However the HTS is not party to the agreement. Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said ""military aircraft"" had targeted the market in Maaret al-Numan blaming the regime for the strike. ""At least 11 people were killed including two children"" he said. ""There are around 20 wounded and the toll of victims could rise."" The Observatory relies on a network of sources inside Syria and says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. The Observatory said that on Friday and Saturday at least 13 civilians died in suspected regime air strikes around Khan Sheikhun the site of a deadly April chemical attack. Despite months of relative calm in Idlib Syrian regime and Russian forces have in recent weeks carried out air raids across the province killing dozens of civilians according to the Observatory. Pro-Turkey Syrian rebels are also preparing for an operation to oust HTS militants from Idlib province. Turkish forces fired seven mortar rounds across the border into Syria on Sunday the Dogan news agency reported a day after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the operation. Ankara has massed forces and tanks on its border with Syria but the assault has yet to begin in earnest monitors and sources on the ground said."

Airstrikes by the US-led coalition killed at least 21 civilians in and around a stronghold of the Islamic State group in northern Syria on Monday. At least 15 civilians were killed in raids in a northern district of Manbij while six others were killed in a village near the city according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The extremist bastion has faced more than a month-long US-backed offensive by Kurdish and Arab fighters that has caused thousands of civilians to flee. However tens of thousands of civilians are still trapped in Manbij most of which is controlled by the extremists. On June 23 the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters broke into western districts of Manbij after blocking the road south of the city heading to ISs de facto capital of Raqqa. But their advance has been slowed in the past month because of landmines planted by the militants which are also fighting back by launching suicide attacks against the SDF. Founded in October the Kurdish-dominated alliance has seized territory from IS across large parts of northern and northeastern Syria. Capturing Manbij would be its most significant victory yet. Syrias war has killed more than 280000 people and displaced millions since it started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests. 	 	 Read Also"

Tags Belgium Syria coalition air raids strikes Aleppo Russia has accused Belgium a member of a US-led coalition fighting militants in Syria of killing six civilians in airstrikes in the Aleppo region but the claim was swiftly denied by Brussels. ""Six people were killed and four people injured to various degrees as a result of bombing that destroyed two homes"" in the village of Hassajik in the Aleppo region early on Tuesday the Russian defence ministry said in a statement. ""Two of Belgiums F-16s were identified at that time in the region"" it said late Tuesday. ""There were no Russian and Syrian air force planes in this region."" Belgian defence ministry spokeswoman Laurence Mortier denied the countrys air force was active in the area at the time. Moscow had announced on Tuesday that the Russian and Syrian air forces had stopped bombing Aleppo to pave the way for an eight-hour truce on Thursday. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova took a jab at the United States on Wednesday calling on the State Department to release statements ""strongly condemning strikes against civilian targets and the murder of civilians"". ""I think that photographs of the dead will not be difficult to find to launch an appropriate campaign on CNN"" she wrote on Facebook. The brutal government offensive against rebel-held eastern Aleppo - which has destroyed hospitals and other civilian infrastructure - has plunged Syria into some of the worst violence of the five-year war that has claimed over 300000 lives. The West has accused Russia of potential war crimes over its bombing campaign in Aleppo in support of the regime offensive. The US State Department voiced scepticism regarding Moscows planned truce while welcoming a halt in the bombardments. President Vladimir Putin is set to face Western pressure over the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine at international talks in Berlin on Wednesday as Russia comes under increasing criticism over its support for Damascus. Russian airstrikes have killed thousands of civilians since Moscow intervened in September 2015. But US-led coalition strikes have also claimed hundreds of civilian lives in parts of Syria. According to a report by the Syrian Network for Human Rights published on Wednesday coalition strikes targeting mainly IS-held areas in eastern and northern Syria have killed 649 civilians since September 2014.

A suicide bomber killed five Kurdish policemen at a checkpoint in Syrias divided northeastern city of Qamishli on Saturday police said. Four others were wounded in the attack on the citys demarcation line according to Jowan Ibrahim the commander of the Kurdish police known as the Asayish. It was not immediately clear who carried out the attack but the Takfiri group ISIL has claimed previous bombings in the mainly Kurdish city. Control of Qamishli is split between Kurdish fighters and pro-government fighters who agreed a truce last week after several days of rare clashes. The army and the Kurds have coordinated on security against ISIL in surrounding Hasakeh province but tensions have built up between the sometimes-rival authorities. The army and its ally the National Defense Forces control Qamishli airport and parts of the city as well as areas of the provincial capital Hasakeh to the south. Nearly all of the rest of the province is controlled by the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) who have declared an autonomous region across the mainly Kurdish northern areas they control.

At least 1300 people have been killed in a nerve gas attack on Syrias Ghouta region leading opposition figure George Sabra said on Wednesday. In response the opposition Syrian National Coalition called for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting on the subject. I call on the Security Council to convene urgently National Coalition leader Ahmed al-Jarba added to Al-Arabiya news channel condemning the Syrian armys bombardment of the Ghouta suburbs of Damascus as a massacre. Meanwhile The Arab League called Wednesday on U.N. chemical weapons inspectors now inside Syria to immediately visit the site of the incident. Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi urged the inspectors in a statement to go immediately to Eastern Ghouta to see the reality of the situation and investigate the circumstances of this crime. Britain said on Wednesday it would raise a reported chemical weapons attack by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at the United Nations Security Council and called on Damascus to give U.N. inspectors access to the site Reuters reported. I am deeply concerned by reports that hundreds of people including children have been killed in airstrikes and a chemical weapons attack on rebel-held areas near Damascus British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. France also called for action by the U.N. during a cabinet session Hollande announced his intention to ask the U.N. to visit the site of the attack government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem told reporters on Wednesday. This information obviously requires verification and confirmation she added. Activists at the Syrian Revolutionary Command Council said regime fighter planes were flying over the area after the bombardment accusing the forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad of using chemical agents. The attack was on rebel-held areas of eastern Damascus. Regime forces ... stepped up military operations in the Eastern Ghouta and Western Ghouta zones of the Damascus region with aircraft and rocket launchers causing several dozen dead and wounded the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told AFP news agency. The intensive bombing on the outskirts of the capital could be heard by residents of Damascus where a grey cloud capped the sky. The Britain-based Observatory which relies on a vast network of activists on the ground and medics said the army operation was aimed at the recapture of Madhamiyat el-Sham an area southwest of Damascus. The Local Coordination Committees (LCC) a network of activists reported hundreds of casualties in the brutal use of toxic gas by the criminal regime in parts of Western Ghouta. According to Reuters news agency the reported use of the chemical agents could not be immediately verified. The news coincides with a visit to Damascus by a United Nations team of chemical weapons experts. In an interview with Al Arabiya Syrian National Coalition chief Ahmad Jarba called on the U.N. investigators to travel to Ghouta the site of the massacre. Activists from the grassroots Local Coordination Committee reported at least 30 bodies had been brought to one field hospital in Kafr Batna neighborhood a few miles east of central Damascus according to Reuters. Meanwhile the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said dozens of people were killed including children in fierce bombardment. Activists at the Local Coordinating Committees said Mouadamiya southwest of the capital came under the heaviest attack since the start of the two-year conflict. Regime denial Meanwhile Syrian authorities denied charges that the army used chemical weapons in the attacks. Reports on the use of chemical weapons in (the suburbs of) Ghouta are totally false state news agency SANA said. It dismissed as unfounded the reports from opposition activists and said satellite news channels carrying the reports are implicated in the shedding of Syrian blood and support terrorism. Its an attempt to prevent the U.N. commission of inquiry from carrying out its mission the statement added. (With Reuters and AFP)

The United States launched cruise missiles at a Syrian air base last week in response to a deadly poison gas attack in the west of the country that Washington blamed on Bashar al-Assads regime. Syria and its ally Russia deny Damascus carried out any such chemical attack. Moscow has said the poison gas in that incident last week in Idlib province belonged to rebels. The U.S. strike on the Syrian air base was the first time Washington has deliberately and directly targeted the Syrian government. It is separately waging an air campaign against Daesh in eastern Syria."

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the blast targeted buses carrying residents evacuated from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya under a deal reached between the regime and rebels. Bodies were still being recovered from the attack at a transit point in Rashidin west of Aleppo according to the observatory. ""The suicide bomber was driving a van supposedly carrying aid supplies and detonated near the buses"" the monitoring group said. It said that most of the dead were evacuees but also included several rebels who had been guarding the buses. Thousands of evacuees had been stuck on the road because of a disagreement over the number of rebels allowed to leave two other towns included in the deal but the process restarted following the blast the observatory said. AFPs reporter in rebel-held Rashidin saw several bodies body parts and blood scattered on the ground. The bombing took place as thousands of evacuees from Fuaa and Kafraya waited to continue their journey to regime-controlled Aleppo the coastal province of Latakia or Damascus. More than 5000 people who had lived under crippling siege for more than two years left the two towns along with 2200 evacuated from rebel-held Madaya and Zabadani on Friday. Syrias war has left more than 320000 people dead since erupting in 2011 with more than half the population forced from their homes and hundreds of thousands enduring siege-like conditions. It has sucked in regional and international powers and allowed extremist groups to seize vast areas of the country. US-backed fighters reached the outskirts of a key extremist-held town in northern Syria on Saturday as part of an offensive aimed at the Daesh bastion of Raqqa. SDF advances The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) an Arab-Kurdish alliance supported by US-led coalition air strikes and special forces advisers surrounded Tabaqa in early April and have cut its main supply routes. The town and a vast nearby dam are considered key prizes in the broader offensive for Raqqa the de facto Syrian capital of Daeshs self-proclaimed caliphate about 55 kilometres to the east. An SDF military source said Saturday that clashes were fierce and that the alliances forces were trying to penetrate the town from the east and west. The alliance was reported to have advanced overnight after driving the extremists from two areas just southeast and southwest of the town. SDF fighters are within a few hundred metres of Tabaqa said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. He said heavy clashes were under way around the two suburbs as Daesh attempted to counter-attack. The SDF launched its campaign for Raqqa in November and has since captured most of the surrounding province. It has been backed by US-led coalition air strikes along with advisers and even an American Marines artillery battery. Raqqa was home to around 240000 residents before 2011 and more than 80000 people have fled to the city from other parts of the country since the start of Syrias civil war. Tabaqa sits on a key supply route into Raqqa and served as an important Daesh command base housing the groups main prison. Backed by Russia and local militias pro-government forces have made a string of recent gains. The government and rebels have brokered a series of deals to evacuate people from besieged areas which Damascus touts as the best way to end the violence. Rebels say they are forced out by siege and bombardment. The deal involving the evacuees targeted on Saturday has been beset by delays and the 5000 Fuaa and Kafraya residents had waited in Rashidin for more than a day without moving before the bomb went off an AFP correspondent said. Around 2220 evacuees from Madaya and Zabadani were similarly blocked at a transit point in government-held territory one of them told AFP by telephone. State television said the car bombing had been carried out by terrorist groups a term the regime applies to all armed opposition groups. Many residents had earlier expressed regret over not knowing when if ever they would be able to return to their homes. Its terrible to be uprooted like this to go and live in a place that is not ours said Jama Nayef a vet from Fuaa."

Five children were among those killed in the air raids on Idlib which is held by Al Qaeda affiliate Al Nusra Front and its allies the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Peace talks towards ending Syrias five-year war have stalled with no immediate end in sight to a conflict that has killed 280000 people. It was not clear who carried out the Idlib strikes but the observatory has reported previous air raids by the regime and its Russian ally on Idlib province which is also controlled by Al Nusra and rebel allies. Footage the observatory said was filmed after the Idlib strikes showed emergency workers training water hoses on a tall building amid a haze of smoke. In Maaret Al Numan an area south of the provincial capital unidentified warplanes also killed at least six civilians including a woman and her four children the observatory said. Russia launched air strikes in support of the Damascus regime in September allowing forces loyal to President Bashar Assad to advance against the rebels and Daesh. The Britain-based observatory relies on a wide network of sources inside Syria for its information. It says it determines what aircraft carried out raids based on their location flight patterns and the types of planes and munitions involved. The observatory said Russian air strikes killed 23 civilians in strikes on Idlib city on May 31 but Russia denied carrying out raids there that day. Suspected government strikes killed at least 37 civilians in Maaret Al Numan in April sparking condemnation from Syrias opposition amid faltering peace talks Civilians flee Daesh bastion Meanwhile hundreds of civilians escaped the Daesh stronghold of Manbij in nearby Aleppo province on Sunday helped by a US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance surrounding the town. Tens of thousands had been trapped inside Manbij after the alliance encircled the town on Friday in a major blow to the terrorist group controlling it. Around 600 civilians fled on foot towards areas held by the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance south of the town observatory Chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. The SDF transported them to safer areas. Those still inside the town were terrified by heavy air strikes in the area Abdel Rahman said and food was becoming scarce after the SDF alliance blocked all roads in and out. At least 223 Daesh fighters and 28 SDF troops had been killed as well as 41 civilians in coalition air raids since the alliance offensive against Manbij began on May 31 according to the Observatory. Manbij lies at the heart of the last stretch of Daesh-controlled territory along Turkeys border. The siege has severed a key Daesh supply route that had channelled money and weapons from the Turkish border to the groups de facto Syrian capital of Raqqa city. Daesh has come under attack on several fronts since declaring a cross-border caliphate in Syria and Iraq in 2014. Millions of people have been displaced since Syrias civil war started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests. Peace talks hit deadlock after the opposition walked out of negotiations in April over the escalating violence and lack of humanitarian access.

Syrian warplanes bombed opposition-held Idlib province killing at least 22 people. Clashes in Aleppo have also intensified and bombs dropped by the regime killed at least 49 people over the weekend Syrias opposition-held northwestern Idlib province came under heavy bombardment Sunday activists reported as opposition fighters and pro-government forces battled for control of the nearby city of Aleppo. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported 26 airstrikes across the province one of the last remaining bastions of opposition control. 22 people were killed during the airstrikes. Opposition groups in Idlib home to a pre-war population of 1.5 million are mounting an offensive to seize contested Aleppo. Tens of thousands of Syrians displaced from Aleppo province have found refuge in Idlib. The Local Coordination Committees an activist network said Russian jets struck the towns of Jisr al-Shaghour and Binnish while the Observatory reported strikes on the provincial capital Idlib. It was unclear how the activists identified the planes. Moscow has been waging an air campaign in support of government forces for nearly a year. Russias military said six long-range Tu-22M3 bombers that took off from Russian territory carried out strikes Sunday on DAESH near the eastern Syrian city of Deir el-Zour. The strikes killed a large number of militants while destroying two command posts six arms caches two tanks four armored infantry vehicles and seven all-terrain vehicles with heavy machine guns the Defense Ministry statement said. The ministry made no mention of any strikes in Idlib. Elsewhere in Syria opposition groups and government forces battled around a major power plant in the central Hama province. State media reported that opposition fighters inflicted heavy damage to the Zaara generating station while an opposition media activist in the nearby town of Aqrab said the power plant was not targeted. Obeida al-Hamawi of the activist-run Hama Media Center said government forces had launched an assault from positions near the plant to retake the village of Zaara captured by opposition groups earlier this year. He said electricity was still being supplied to the area. The Observatory reported heavy clashes in the area. Clashes and airstrikes meanwhile continued across the northern Aleppo province resulting in at least 49 civilian deaths on Saturday alone activists and state media reported. Five children were among the dead. The Observatory said government airstrikes and shelling on opposition areas in Aleppo city and the surrounding countryside killed 40 civilians Saturday while the Local Coordination Committees put the toll in opposition areas at 45 dead. State media and the Observatory said opposition shelling on government-held districts of Aleppo city killed nine civilians including two children. State media said another 22 people were wounded. Fighting for the city has intensified this summer after regime troops seized control of the last supply route into opposition-held areas in mid-July. After a nearly three-week siege opposition forces took Ramussa on August 6 linking up with opposition-held neighborhoods.

Tags Idlib Syria refugee camp Russian war planes air raid Syrian regime Five women and a child have been killed after Russian or Syrian regime war planes targeted a refugee camp in rebel stronghold Idlib province. Bombs and missiles struck the camp situated in southern Idlib province close to the village of al-Khwyn. The victims are thought to be refugees from elsewhere in Syria who fled to the rebel stronghold of Idlib. Frequent bombing by regime and Russian war planes have seen numerous massacres in Idlib province and have included refugee camps. In May a suspected Russian air raid on Sarmada refugee camp in Idlib province left dozens dead. The UN said it was unlikely that the attack was an accident and that the bombing could amount to a war crime. Last month nearly 1200 Syrian civilians were killed the Syrian Network for Human Rights claimed including 192 children and 163 women - mostly from air raids. ""Regime and Russian forces have violated human rights law that guarantee the right to life"" the Syrian Network for Human Rights commented. Aleppo has also witnessed massive air raids in recent weeks one of the most ferocious aerial assaults since the start of the war. with hundreds of civilians killed since the breakdown of a ceasefire last month.

__label__0	__topic__2 Syria fighting worst since Aleppo air strikes deadly: aid agencies October 5 2017 Syria fighting worst since Aleppo air strikes deadly: aid agencies. Stephanie Nebehay. Syria is in the throes of its worst fighting since the battle for eastern Aleppo last year with heavy air strikes causing hundreds of civilian casualties aid agencies said on Thursday. Hospitals schools and people fleeing violence have been targeted by direct air strikes that may amount to war crimes the United Nations said without apportioning blame. Russia and a U.S.-led coalition are carrying out separate air strikes in Syria ostensibly aimed at defeating Islamic State militants. September was the deadliest month of 2017 for civilians with daily reports of attacks on residential areas resulting in hundreds of conflict-related deaths and injuries U.N. regional humanitarian coordinator Panos Moumtzis said in a statement. Air strikes killed dozens this week in Raqqa where 8000 people remain trapped and at least 149 people mostly women and children in residential areas of rebel-dominated Idlib province in Syrias northwest in the last 12 days of September he said. Explosions in Damascus killed 20 people and civilian casualties were also reported in rural areas around the Syrian capital and in Hama Aleppo and Deir al-Zor Moumtzis said again without saying who was responsible. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a statement that up to 10 hospitals were reported to have been damaged in the past 10 days. We have seen a number of hospitals being targeted we got very worrying reports and converging reports about hospitals schools civilian infrastructure being targeted Robert Mardini ICRC regional director for the Middle East told Reuters in an interview in his Geneva office. And of course this is outrageous unacceptable he said adding that damage to Sham hospital in Idlib alone had cut off half a million people from access to health care. The ICRC voiced alarm that violence was occurring in many of the de-escalation areas including Idlib rural Hama and eastern Ghouta. Taken together these are the worst levels of violence since the battle for Aleppo in 2016 it said. Hundreds of civilians killed is certainly a very conservative figure Mardini said. We see a very strong correlation between the escalation and the intensification in the fighting on one hand and the human cost of this conflict the attacks on health facilities and civilian infrastructure. Syrias six-year-old civil war pits President Bashar al-Assads government supported by Russia and Iran against a myriad number of rebel factions some Western-backed and Islamist militant groups. Military jets believed to be Russian killed at least 60 civilians trying to flee heavy fighting in the oil-rich Deir al-Zor province when their small boats were targeted as they sought to cross the Euphrates River opposition activists former residents and a war monitor said late on Wednesday. The U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria has carried out air strikes that have also caused civilian casualties which it says it goes to great lengths to avoid. The point here is not to point fingers Mardini said declining to identify suspected perpetrators of deadly strikes. What should be non-negotiable is the respect for the laws of war everywhere in Syria. This is absolutely critical today.

The monitor said the raids targeted the town of Milis in Idlib province which borders Turkey and is controlled by a rebel alliance led by Al-Qaedas former Syrian branch. The Britain-based monitor said three children and two women were among the dead adding that the raids were carried out by either Russian or regime warplanes. The Idlib Media Center which publishes news on developments in the province said a hospital was hit in the raid by unidentified aircraft and that at least six people had been killed. The World Health Organisation said Syria was the most dangerous place for health care workers to operate last year with 135 attacks on health facilities and workers in 2015. In late July four makeshift hospitals and a local blood bank in Syrias battered Aleppo city were hit by air raids in a single day. More than 280000 people have been killed since Syrias conflict erupted in 2011 and millions have been forced to flee including around five million who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries.

__label__0	"__topic__2 Syria uses chemical weapons Turkey offers remedy - lnur evik - Daily Sabah Published April 5 2017 The jet fighters from the Syrian regime have attacked settlements in the Syrian province of Idlib with chemical weapons killing at least 70 people including dozens of women and children and displaying once again the barbarity of the Bashar Assad administration. All this is happening as the so-called cease-fire is in effect in the region and the Russians are ""monitoring"" it. Idlib was the target of the regime because opposition groups and those sympathizing with them have moved out of Aleppo through an agreement brokered by Turkey and Russia. The cease-fire was supposed to have secured protection for the people of Idlib but that has been proven wrong as the regime jet fighters attacked the city with chemical bombs. Local sources reported that Syrian helicopters also attacked several settlements in the area with barrel bombs containing chemical weapons. Doctors in the town of Khan Skeikhoun in the Idlib province held by the opposition said victims started to choke vomit and faint with foam coming out of their mouths. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said women and children were among the dozens killed with reports of ""suffocation"" by barrel bombs. The Assad regime is back to using chemical weapons. So what will the international community do in view of this monstrous atrocity? The Assad regime has done this before and after the international uproar it had ""given up"" its chemical weapons to international observers. We were told Assad did not have chemical weapons. So now that Assad is back to using these weapons it seems the international community intentionally or unintentionally simply turned a blind eye and the Assad regime simply stored the weapons to be used at a future date. The Russian mentors of the terrorist Assad who themselves face terrorist attacks in their own backyard in St. Petersburg have to see that collaborating with terrorists only brings misery and destruction. This time Assad has to be stopped. The chemical weapons Assad uses have to be taken away from him for good and he has to pay for his atrocities. Even the Russians cannot stand behind Assad as he commits these gross violations. The Americans cant simply say they are just interested in fighting Daesh and just turn a blind eye to the dangerous turn of events in Idlib. Tomorrow someone in Syria may decide to use such weapons against the U.S. forces there.Turkey is trying to create its own secure zone that Assad would never dare attack in northern Syria. But the fact that Assad is using his jet fighters and helicopters to attack even the civilians who sympathize with the Syrian opposition shows the urgent need for declaring the safe zones created by Turkey as no-fly zones. This is something that has to be looked into by the international community. The Russians can secure this zone with their air power and their ground to air S-400 missile systems thus at least offering some hope for the Syrian people trying to escape Assads atrocities."

Tags Syria warplane shelling pilot Jayrud Qalamoun Jaish al-Islam al-Nusra Front At least 43 people have been killed by Syrian regime shelling in a rebel-held town northeast of the Syrian capital after a downed government pilot was executed by rebels. The bombardment hit the town of Jayrud on Saturday where Islamist rebels killed a pilot they captured after he was forced to eject on Friday. ""At least two of the killed in Jayrud were medical staff"" head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Rami Abdel Rahman said. ""Prominent figures in Jayrud have had a local truce with the regime for at least two years and neither fired on each other"" he added. Jaish al-Islam spokesman Islam Alloush said on Friday that al-Nusra Front had executed an air force pilot in Jayrud after his plane was shot down by Jaish al-Islam. ""We have been surprised by members of al-Nusra killing the pilot whose plane we shot down after they pledged to hand him over us"" Alloush said on Twitter. Alloush identified the pilot as Lieutenant Nawras Hassan and posted an interview with him before he was killed. 	 	Images of the captured pilot were released [Twitter] In a Friday statement about the incident Syrian state media said the attack ""would not go unpunished."" It added that the plane had crashed due to ""technical failure during a training mission"". Rebel groups in Jayrud 60 kilometres from Damascus include the Saudi-backed Jaish al-Islam the hardline Ahrar al-Sham and al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front. Jaish al-Islam like the al-Qaida affiliate is considered a terrorist group by the Syrian government and Russia. Several government aircraft have been shot down by rebels or crashed because of technical faults since the civil war erupted five years ago. Also on Saturday Jaish al-Islam said it had shot down a regime drone near the village of al-Bahariya in eastern Ghouta. The conflict has killed more than 280000 people and displaced millions."

Rebel groups including the powerful Ahrar al-Sham faction and former Al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front fired waves of rockets into government-held western Aleppo killing at least 15 civilians a monitor said. The rebels also targeted government positions east of Aleppo city and in the coastal province of Latakia including the Hmeimim military base used by Russian forces allied with the regime. Moscow says it has not bombed Aleppo since October 18 but senior Russian military official Sergei Rudskoi told a briefing Friday that the military had asked President Vladimir Putin for authorisation to resume its air strikes. ""We have appealed to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation with a request to resume air strikes"" Rudskoi said. But the Kremlin said Putin did not agree. ""The Russian president considers it inappropriate at the current moment to resume strikes on Aleppo"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said adding that Putin thought it was necessary to ""continue the humanitarian pause"" in the war-ravaged city. ""The Russian side retains the right in case of extreme necessity to use all the troops and facilities it has to carry out support of the Syrian armed forces at the necessary level"" he added. Fridays rebel assault comes more than three months into a government siege of eastern Aleppo where more than 250000 people live and several weeks after the army began an operation to retake the rebel east. Rebel groups ""announce the start of the battle to break the siege of Aleppo"" said Abu Yusef Muhajir a military commander and spokesman for Ahrar al-Sham. The assault ""will end the regime occupation of western Aleppo and break the siege on the people trapped inside"" he told AFP. ""The breaking of the siege is inevitable"" said Yasser al-Yusef a member of the political office of the Nureddine al-Zinki rebel group. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitor said at least 15 civilians including a woman and two children had been killed and more than 100 wounded in rebel fire on western Aleppo. The monitor reported fierce clashes on multiple fronts on the western and southern outskirts of west Aleppo with three suicide car bombs targeting a checkpoint in the Dahiyet al-Assad neighbourhood. Fighting was continuing in the area near a military academy it said but had no immediate toll. An AFP correspondent in east Aleppo said the assault had boosted morale in rebel-held districts with mosques broadcasting ""God is greatest"" from loudspeakers. He said residents burned tyres to create smoke and provide cover against air attack. Heavy rain put the fires out but also hampered Syrian air operations creating what one rebel dubbed ""a divine no-fly zone"". The Observatory said rebels had also fired dozens of rockets at the Nairab military airport and Aleppo international airport both east of the city and government-controlled. Rebels also fired rockets from Idlib province into the government stronghold of Latakia killing one person and wounding six. Rockets struck close to the Hmeimim military airport as well as near President Bashar al-Assads ancestral village Qardaha the monitor said. State television said ""the army has foiled an attempt by terrorists to attack Aleppo city from several axes with suicide bomb attacks and has inflicted losses on them"". State news agency SANA said government planes were carrying out air strikes south and west of Aleppo. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo has been ravaged by the conflict that began in March 2011 with anti-government protests and has since killed more than 300000 people. Aleppo has been divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012 and in September the army announced an operation to recapture the whole city. The UNs aid chief Stephen OBrien this week said Aleppo had become ""a kill zone"" adding that ""nothing is actually happening to stop the war stop the suffering"". Last week Russia implemented a three-day ""humanitarian truce"" intended to allow civilians and surrendering rebels to leave the east. But few did so and a UN plan to evacuate the wounded failed because security could not be guaranteed. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused UN agencies Friday of ""not being professional enough"" over Aleppo. Speaking in Moscow after meeting the Syrian and Iranian foreign ministers he said ""Their inaction allowed the medical evacuation to be sabotaged."" UN chief Ban Ki-moon meanwhile condemned an attack on a school in government-held west Aleppo on Thursday that killed at killed at least six children according to state media. ""Such attacks if deliberate may amount to war crimes"" he said in a statement."

SANA reporter said that terrorists positioned in Bustan al-Qaser neighborhood fired three shells on Shahba Hotel in Aleppo which is the residence for the UN staff and no causalities were reported among the hotel guests or the UN staff. The reporter added that two of the shells fell on a residential building near the hotel causing a huge material damage. In turn the UN Resident Representative in Syria Ali al-Zaatari said in a statement that the UN Office to the west of Aleppo City was shelled with tanks causing a material damage in the upper floors of the building.

Citing news from its local partners in Syria UNICEF have said that the bodies of children were pulled from the rubble in the Islamic State group-dominated town of al-Quria. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported the airstrikes on Saturday with an initial death toll of 47. This was later updated to 82 on Sunday including 58 civilians.

""UNICEF deplores these attacks and calls on all parties to the conflict to keep children out of harms way."" Deir Ez-Zor province links the IS group stronghold of Raqqa to their territory in neighbouring Iraq. Syrian government forces backed by Russia are currently attempting to drive militant groups out of their Syrian strongholds however dozens of civilians have been killed in this effort in recent days.

Also on Monday state news agency SANA said two people were killed when mortars struck central Damascus. The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said air strikes killed 29 people on Sunday including women and children in the southern Al-Ferdous district of Aleppo a city that was once Syrias largest and a major commercial hub. Another 14 people were killed in the Baeedeen neighbourhood in ""barrel bomb"" attacks - strikes in which helicopters drop highly destructive improvised explosives - the group said. A further five died in barrel bomb attacks in the village of Tlajabin it added. Western powers have condemned the use of barrel bombs as a war crime but they continue to fall nearly every day in Aleppo and other parts of Syria. SANA said two people were killed in Damascus when mortars fired by ""terrorists"" - its term for rebel fighters - hit the Al-Salihiya neighbourhood of the capital and a nearby area. More than 150000 people have been killed in Syrias conflict which started as a peaceful protest movement against President Bashar al-Assads rule in March 2011 and turned into civil war after a government crackdown."

Several villages held by Islamic State have been captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a coalition of militias backed by the United States that includes a strong Kurdish contingent an organisation that monitors the war said on Monday. Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighters walk in Tal Samin village north of Raqqa city Syria November 19 2016. REUTERS/Rodi Said The advance is part of a military campaign backed by an international coalition led by the United States to drive Islamic State from its Syrian capital of Raqqa. It follows SDF gains against the jihadist group across the north of the country. The strongest group in the SDF is the Peoples Protection Units or YPG a Kurdish militia but Washington has said that any operation to retake Raqqa should be predominantly Arab the ethnicity of most of the citys residents. The latest advances in the countryside about 50 km (30 miles) west and northwest of Raqqa follow an earlier phase of SDF gains on another front about 30 km north of the city. Three SDF soldiers were killed fighting Islamic State after the capture of five villages the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based war monitor said on Monday. Islamic State had been on the back foot in both Syria and Iraq where it is under attack in Mosul its biggest and most important possession and after a string of U.S. air strikes that have killed many of its leaders this year. However earlier this month it launched a surprise attack 160 km southwest of Raqqa to retake the ancient desert city of Palmyra which it had lost in March to Syrian army forces backed by Russian air power after a nine-month occupation. That attack demonstrated the risks still posed by the group across Syria even after its territorial losses there since mid-2015 including holdings along the Turkish border which were once its main route for supplies and recruits. Complicating the efforts against Islamic State is a second campaign being waged against it in northwest Syria by Turkey and Syrian rebel groups allied to Ankara. This has taken a large area from the jihadist group but is also aimed at stopping Kurdish expansion. The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels are now attempting to capture the city of al-Bab from Islamic State a move that will end Kurdish hopes of uniting their two separated areas of self rule in northern Syria. Early on Monday the Turkish military said one of its soldiers had been killed in a car bomb in al-Bab on Sunday and that 11 militants were also killed in clashes that day.

The official SANA news agency said two suicide bombers one in a car attacked the entrance to the Sayyida Zeinab shrine which is revered by Shiites around the world. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a British-based monitoring group said at least 20 people were killed including 13 civilians and more than 30 wounded in the blasts. SANA gave a toll of at least 12 dead and 55 wounded. Daesh claimed the attack via its Amaq news agency saying it was carried out by three suicide bombers. The shrine around 10 kilometres (six miles) south of the centre of Damascus is heavily guarded by pro-government forces but has still been the target of several attacks including those claimed by the Daesh terrorist group. Syrias official Al-Ikhbariya channel showed images from the scene of burned-out cars billowing with plumes of black smoke. Firefighters battled to extinguish the flames as shop signs lay in the street. The last attack on Sayyida Zeinab on April 25 killed at least seven and wounded dozens. A string of Daesh bombings near the shrine in February left 134 people dead most of them civilians according to the Observatory. And in January another attack claimed by Daes killed 70 people. Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah cited the threat to Sayyida Zeinab as a principal reason for its intervention in Syrias civil war on the side of Bashar al-Assad. The shrine contains the grave of Zeinab a venerated granddaughter of the Prophet Mohammed and is renowned for its glistening golden onion-shaped dome.

The Syrian Coalition condemns the brutal massacre committed by Assads air force in Raqqa today where 65 civilians were killed and dozens wounded in multiple air raids that targeted civilian neighborhoods in the city. Hadi al-Bahra president of the Syrian Coalition warns that the Assad regime will repeat such brutal aerial shelling; pointing out that many seem now convinced that Assad is the major beneficiary of the US-led coalition strikes against ISIS. He calls for the US-led coalition to rethink its strategy in Syria. Activists said that Assads warplanes conducted nine air raids on the city of Al Raqqa killing dozens of civilians and causing massive material damage to the residential areas pointing out none of ISIS positions were targeted in the attacks. Bahra calls on civil and human rights organizations and activists around the world to take action to support the Syrian peoples demands for freedom democracy by all means. it is disappointing how there are dozens of sides that support extremist organizations with money and men and how there are several international sides that support Assad with militiamen weapons money and diplomatic backing while the international community has so far failed to support the Syrian peoples demands for freedom and democracy.

The activists said some corpses were even beyond recognition. The bombs were dropped on a camp near al-Habeet in the northern province of Idlib on Wednesday killing mostly women and children at the camp. Footage posted on YouTube showed corpses of women and children and burning tents while people scrambled to save the wounded. ""Its a massacre of refugees"" a voice off camera said. ""Let the whole world see this they are displaced people. Look at them. They are civilians displaced civilians"" he said. The U.S. said it was ""horrified"" by the reports of the bombing adding that it could not confirm details. ""The attack on the Abedin camp was nothing short of barbaric"" said state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki. ""Unfortunately if it is confirmed to be the work of the [Assad] regime it is only the latest act of brutality by the regime against its own people."" Camp residents told Reuters that the attack took place on Wednesday with two barrel bombs dropped from an army helicopter. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also confirmed that the Assad regime carried out the air attack on the camp. U.S. officials acknowledged Wednesday that the solution to the crisis in Syria would ultimately require Assads removal even though coalition operations do not target his regime. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said the solution in Syria will ""ultimately have to result in Assads departure."" She added ""You have an illegitimate and exceedingly violent leadership that has created conditions not only that have been so harmful to the population but have made it a very attractive magnet for terrorists"" while speaking at the Harman Center for the Arts based in Washington. Rices deputy Tony Blinken speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said that the train and equip program that the coalition will sponsor for moderate Syrian opposition fighters will also fight the Assad regime. Responding to a question as to why airstrikes do not target Assad forces that drop barrel bombs on civilians Blinken said the strategic plan of the coalition is to ultimately destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). Blinken said the challenge for keeping the coalition is to deal with the different agendas that each country has. Blinken added in the end that the ""glue holding them together"" is ISISs violence. The war in Syria which started in March 2011 with pro-democracy protests but rapidly grew into a horrific civil war has caused the death of more than 200000 people and at least 60000 are missing. The war also displaced nearly 10 million people. The Assad regime has been accused of committing war crimes against civilians by insurgent groups."

Tags White Helmets SARC war crimes UN aid convoy Urum al-Kubra Aleppo Russian and regime warplanes were behind the ""deliberate attacks"" that targeted a UN-Red Crescent [SARC] convoy on Monday night killing scores of volunteers and civilians the Syrian Civil Defence confirmed in a statement late on Tuesday. The planes struck the convoy as trucks unloaded aid in the town of Urum al-Kubra west of Aleppo city then struck again as Civil Defence crews arrived on the scene the statement added. Fifteen SARC volunteers were killed in the ""double-tap"" strike said the Civil Defence also known as the White Helmets who were among the first responders and more than 25 were injured. The strikes also destroyed most of the aid. The statement described the attack as a crime insisting the whereabouts of the convoy were known to all parties. Earlier the UN decided to suspend all aid convoys in Syria pending the re-evaluation of the security situation following the attack on the convoy in Urum al-Kubra. Reuters quoting US officials said on Tuesday that two Russian Sukhoi SU-24 warplanes were in the skies above an aid convoy in Syria at the precise time it was struck on Monday. The officials were citing US intelligence that has led them to conclude Russia was to blame. According to a CNN report the US has reached the preliminary conclusion that Russian warplanes bombed an aid convoy and warehouse belonging to SARC. ""All the evidence we have points to that conclusion"" one of the officials said. The White House meanwhile said that Russia holds responsibility for the strike regardless of whether it was their planes that attacked. ""All of our information indicates clearly that this was an airstrike. That means there only could have been two entities responsible"" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on Tuesday night naming Moscow and the Syrian regime. He didnt specify which countrys planes carried out the strike. ""We hold the Russian government responsible for airstrikes in this airspace given their commitment under the cessation of hostilities was to ground air operations where humanitarian assistance was flowing"" Rhodes said referring to the terms of a recent ceasefire brokered between the US and Russia. Russia has denied its aircraft or those of its Syrian government allies were involved in the incident in which 18 trucks from a 31-vehicle convoy were destroyed. The strike appeared to deal a fatal blow to Syrias fragile week-old ceasefire. Read Also"

DAESH said that it killed at least 50 opposition fighters in a suicide bombing on a bus near the Atmeh border crossing with Turkey. The opposition faces the DAESH threat while fighting intensively against the Syrian regime in Idlib and Aleppo DAESH said on Monday they were responsible for a suicide bombing on a bus on Sunday which killed fighters from western-backed Syrian opposition groups near the Atmeh border crossing with Turkey. In a statement on one of its Telegram channels the hard-line militant group said it killed 50 fighters travelling on the bus from the Failaq al-sham and the al-Zinki groups. It said the fighters were travelling to fight against DAESH in northern Aleppo province. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a suicide bomber struck a bus transporting fighters through the Atmeh border post one of several crossings Syrian opposition uses to bring in fighters and supplies. The monitoring group which relies on activists inside Syria said the attack killed 50 fighters. An activist who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution said some 200 fighters from various factions are based near Atmeh and bring in weapons through the crossing. The Observatory had earlier reported 26 airstrikes on Sunday across Idlib one of the last remaining opposition bastions. Observatory head Rami Abdurrahman said Russian and government airstrikes on the province have intensified since opposition fighters launched a campaign from Idlib to break a government siege of Aleppos opposition districts on July 31. The strikes have killed 122 civilians he said. Another 327 civilians including 126 children have been killed in fighting in Aleppo province according to the Observatory. The toll includes 126 people killed by opposition shelling of government-held parts of Aleppo city. The Local Coordination Committees an activist network said Russian jets struck the towns of Jisr al-Shaghour and Binnish while the Observatory reported strikes on the provincial capital Idlib. It was unclear how the activists identified the planes. Aleppo is still home to some 2 million people most of whom live in the government-controlled western districts. Syrian government forces on Monday repelled a renewed opposition assault southwest of the city of Aleppo forcing opposition forces to retreat from positions they seized a daily earlier the Syrian government and activists said. The development followed intense battles between the two sides. Tens of thousands of Syrians displaced from Aleppo have found refuge in Idlib home to a pre-war population of 1.5 million. On Sunday evening opposition fighters opened a new front sending a truck bomb into Aleppos western Zahraa neighborhood according to the Twitter account of the Islamic Front one of the factions fighting for the city. The Observatory reported fighting in the citys western and southern districts. Moscow has been waging an air campaign in support of government forces for nearly a year. Russias military said six long-range Tu-22M3 bombers that took off from Russian territory carried out strikes Sunday on DAESH near the eastern Syrian city of Deir el-Zour. It made no mention of any strikes in Idlib. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday that Syrian opposition groups had used temporary ceasefires in and around Aleppo to regroup and rearm. Lavrov speaking at a news conference in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg with his German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he realized that brief daily ceasefires in place now to allow aid to enter and civilians to leave were not sufficient. But he said it was difficult to make the ceasefires longer for the moment because of the risk of militants using them to regroup and rearm something he said they had done in the past. German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said the hardships faced by people in Aleppo could not be alleviated by announcing three-hour ceasefires. ""Its supposed to sound like a concession but its actually cynicism because everybody knows that this amount of time is nowhere near sufficient to actually build up supplies for the desperate people there"" he told a government news conference. He said the killing in Aleppo had to stop and the city needed to receive food and medical items without hindrance. Seibert said Syrias Bashar Assad and Russia an ally of Assad against opposition in Syrias five-year-old civil war were largely responsible for the situation in the city ""Its primarily their decision whether there will be further deaths or whether the people there get help and hope after months of suffering."""

Kerry called to make clear that if as they claimed the Syrian regime has nothing to hide it should have allowed immediate and unimpeded access to the site rather than continuing to attack the affected area to block access and destroy evidence a State Department was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. Syrian opposition groups have accused President Bashar al-Assads forces of launching massive chemical attacks near Damascus on August 21 and killing as many as 1300 people. Infographic: Chemical weapons claims (Design by Farwa Rizwan / Al Arabiya English) The Syrian government has strongly denied those allegations but has yet to accede to demands that U.N. inspectors already in the country be allowed to visit the sites of the alleged attacks AFP news agency reports. The secretary further emphasized ... that he had received full assurances from Free Syrian Army commanders that they would ensure the safety of U.N. investigators into the targeted areas the official said. In all these calls the secretary emphasized the importance of quickly determining the facts and underscored the seriousness and gravity of any chemical weapons use the official said. U.S. President Barack Obama received a detailed review of a range of potential options from his top advisers on Saturday on how Washington and its allies could respond to an alleged chemical weapons attack on Damascus by the Syrian government Reuters reported the White House as saying.

For its part the Takfiri ISIL group claimed responsibility for the attack. In a statement circulated on social media it said the attack was carried out by a bomber in an explosives-laden truck. The terrorist group said the attack was ""a response to the crimes committed by the crusader coalition aircraft"" in the town of Manbij a bastion of the Takfiri group in Syrias Aleppo province. "

Areas hit included a market and at least five children were among those killed the British-based Observatory said. It said the death toll was expected to rise because of the number of people seriously wounded. It said it did not know whether Syrian or Russian jets had carried out the strikes. Both are operating in the area. Russia deployed warplanes to Syria last year to support President Bashar al-Assad against rebels seeking to end his rule and have supported Syrian government forces in a separate fight against Islamic State (IS) group further east. Idlib city and the province by the same name is a stronghold of rebel groups including the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. Air raids in the town of Maarat al-Numan about 30 km (20 miles) south of Idlib killed another six people the Observatory said. There has been heavy bombardment of areas in Idlib province in recent weeks including air strikes that killed at least 23 people last month. Fighting in Syrias five-year civil war has intensified since a February ceasefire deal which took hold in the west of the country but excluded al Qaeda and IS group but quickly began to unravel.

__label__1	__topic__2 Syrian Coalition: Russia Offering the Syrian People a Choice between Accepting Assads Terms or Total Annihilation Monday 02 May 2016 20:08 Syrian Coalition: Russia Offering the Syrian People a Choice between Accepting Assads Terms or Total Annihilation. Vice-president of the Syrian Coalition Muwaffaq Nyrabia said that Russias policies in Syria are designed to put Syrians in front of two hard choices: either to accept Assads terms in the Geneva negotiations or the bombing and destruction of whole cities and vital civilian facilities will continue. Nyrabia pointed out that the aftermath of the deadly airstrikes by the Assad regime and Russian forces on Aleppo over the past ten days indicates systematic and deliberate attacks against residents of the city. He added that this brutal onslaught on Aleppo is clearly aimed at thwarting the political process. The Syrian Institute of Justice said it had documented 270 civilians killed by Russian and regime bombing in Aleppo during April. The victims included 51 children 28 women five rescue workers and seven medical staff members. The Institute pointed out that the Assad regime and Russian forces pounded the rebel-held parts of the city with 270 barrel bombs 907 air-to-surface missiles 68 surface to-surface missiles 6 bombs containing white phosphorous 36 cluster bombs and one missile suspected to be containing chemical substances. The regime and Russian attacks targeted 517 civilian homes three industrial zones 240 agricultural areas 13 archaeological sites 6 hospitals a school 4 houses of worship 3 popular markets 4 civilian services centers 19 roads 2 civil defense centers and a bakery.

__label__0	"__topic__2 IS video shows murder of 2 Syrian activists 6 July 2015 So called Islamic State group has posted online a new disturbing video showing the murder of two Syrian activists after they confess to spying. Tags Syria Islamic State activists murder video Palmyra The Islamic State group has released a new video purporting to show the killing of two Syrian activists in the militants stronghold of Raqqa allegedly for spying on the extremists. IS has killed hundreds of people since it declared an Islamic caliphate in June last year with the city of Raqqa as its de facto capital. The video which was posted Monday on an IS-linked Facebook page shows two young men in orange jumpsuits who say they filmed and photographed IS-held areas in Syria and sent footage to a person abroad. They identify themselves as 21-year-old Faysal Hussein Habibi and 20-year-old Bishr Abdul-Azim. They are then tied to a tree after which masked gunmen shoot them in the head at close range. This follows the release of a video posted online n 4 July purportedly showing Islamic State fighters killing 25 Syrian soldiers in the historic town of Palmyra in central Syria. 	 	Scores of Syrian troops and state employees were killed in the days after Palmyra fell to IS. The video showed the soldiers being taken in pickup trucks from the towns notorious Tadmur prison to the amphitheatre. At the theatre they were shot dead by young IS members armed with pistols. Hundreds of people were seen watching the killings. The video did not indicate when the killings took place. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said these shootings took place on 27 May. It was reported in May that scores of Syrian troops and state employees were murdered in the days after the town fell to IS on 22 May 2015. Palmyra is a UNESCO world heritage site famous for its 2000-year-old Roman colonnades other ruins and priceless artifacts. The capture of Palmyra has raised concern that the militants might try to destroy one of the Middle Easts most spectacular archaeological sites a well-preserved Roman-era city on the towns edge as they have destroyed other pre-Islamic ancient monuments elsewhere in Syria and Iraq. On 2 July IS said its militants had destroyed six archaeological pieces from Palmyra that were confiscated from a smuggler. The shootings in the video took place inside the archaeological site and the troops some of whom had bruises and blood on their faces apparently as a result of being beaten were made to kneel in front of a giant IS black flag before being shot in the back of their heads."
