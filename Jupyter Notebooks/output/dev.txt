Tags Syria Rebels De-escalation Damascus Four civilians were killed in the Syrian capital on Sunday after rebel shelling on the central district of Old Damascus a Britain-based monitor and a medical source said. Seven others were wounded in the attack according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor. A doctor receiving the casualties confirmed the death toll and said most of the injured were ""gravely wounded by shrapnel"". The Observatory said shelling on Sunday hit several areas of the capital including the eastern district of Tabbaleh. Meanwhile state news agency SANA said artillery fire killed two people and wounded nine others in the Bab Sharqi area of Old Damascus. It followed a drop in violence in Damascus since the implementation in July of a de-escalation zone in a rebel-held area to its east. Eastern Ghouta is one of four such zones agreed at May peace talks on the Syrian conflict sponsored by rebel backer Turkey and regime supporters Russia and Iran. SANA said four people were wounded on Saturday when two mortar rounds hit the Absasiyeen Square in the centre of the city. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since the countrys conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests. Damascus has been largely spared from the worst of the violence in the six-year war despite being shaken by two bomb attacks in recent weeks. On Wednesday three suicide bombers killed at least two people near the main police headquarters in Damascus in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group. IS also claimed an October 2 bomb attack at a police station in the capital that killed at least 17 people."

President of the Syrian Coalition Anas Alabdah called upon the United Nations to take urgent action to protect civilians in Deir Ezzor who have been suffering injustices by the Assad regime and ISIS. Alabdah met earlier on Saturday with representatives of the Deir Ezzor Consultative Forum. Both sides discussed preparations for the forum due to be held in the Turkish city of Gaziantep on September 25 as well as its objectives and commitments to achieving the goals of the Syrian revolution. Alabdah explained that the Syrian Coalition will prioritize the alleviation of the suffering of civilians in all Syrian provinces including residents of Deir Ezzor in its upcoming meetings most notably its General Assembly meeting to be held on Monday. Deir Ezzor city was the scene of bloody attacks during Eid al-Adha with Russia and the Assad regime bombing ISIS-held parts of the city and its countryside while ISIS bombed regime-held parts. ISIS published a grisly video showing the savage execution of 17 young men from the town of Altibni on the first day of Eid. Organizers of the forum said that it is aimed at utilizing the talents in Deir Ezzor serving the interests of its people and putting an end to the chaos plaguing the province especially after it almost completely fell to ISIS. The forum also seeks to serve as an umbrella bringing together representatives from across the civil and revolutionary spectrum in Deir Ezzor as a first and essential step towards stabilizing and rebuilding the province.

The Syrian Coalition condemned the deadly overnight airstrikes by Russian forces on Idlib city describing the attacks as a heinous massacre and a war crime. A total of 20 rockets fired by Russian jets hit the National Hospital of Idlib residential buildings surrounding Aljalaa Park Alkastanaa roundabout area Alrawda mosque and other areas in the city late on Monday. At least 35 civilians were killed and dozens more injured in the airstrikes. Medical sources in the city said that the bombed hospital went out of service. Regime and Russian forces have lately intensified aerial bombardment on Idlib province. Two children were killed and dozens more were injured in airstrikes on Tuesday morning in the towns of Kafar Takharim Kafranbil Khan Alsibil and Saraqeb in rural Idlib. Civil defense teams said that the death toll resulting from the airstrikes in Idlib is likely to increase as many victims are still trapped under the rubble of their homes. The Turkish Foreign Ministry condemned the massacre committed by Russian aircrafts yesterday calling on the international community to assume its duty to protect civilians in Syria. On May 14 the UN Security Council expressed its outrage at attacks in Syria targeting civilians and medical facilities stressing that these attacks may amount to war crimes. Members of the Security Council reiterated their call on all parties to immediately implement in full the provisions of Security Council resolutions relating to health care in armed conflict.

The bullet-riddled bodies of the three were found on Friday two days after suspected Islamist militants kidnapped them in the oil-rich eastern province of Deir Ezzor said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ISIL which grew from the ranks of Al-Qaeda before splitting with the global terror network is active in both Syria and neighbouring Iraq and seeks to set up an Islamic state that straddles both countries. But the radical group has faced a major backlash from other rebels fighting to topple the Syrian regime and from Al-Qaedas affiliate in Syria Al-Nusra Front amid accusations of atrocities in Syrias three-year war. The FSA this month called for help from ""friendly and brotherly Arab nations"" to fight ISIL in Deir Ezzor. Rebels in Syria including Al-Nusra Front militants have been battling ISIL since the start of the year in fighting that has reportedly killed more than 6000 people. The clashes have mostly raged in the north and east of the country and on Friday ISIL seized control of the areas of Hafez and Muhassen in Deir Ezzor. The FSA officers executed by the jihadists had been kidnapped in Hafez the Britain-based Observatory said. ISIL has been battling Iraqi government forces since June 9 when in launched a lightening offensive in the north of the country."

Tags Syria air strike SOHR ISIS Deir az-Zour al-Asharah civilians Ramadan. Seventeen civilians including eight children were killed in air raids on a market in eastern Syria on Monday the first day of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights [SOHR] said the strikes on al-Asharah a town held by the Islamic State group [IS] in Deir Az-Zour province. ""The market was overcrowded on Monday because people were shopping for Ramadan"" SOHR chief Rami Abdel Rahman said in a televised interview. He said many of those killed were from the same family and that the death toll was likely to rise because of the serious condition of some of the wounded. Local activist Amir al-Huwaidi told The New Arab that the attack was most likely carried out by Russian warplanes. Heavy air raids hit IS-held areas in and outside the divided city of Deir Az-Zour from early on Monday. IS controls more than 60 percent of the city besieging an estimated 200000 people there. The Islamic militant group also controls most of the surrounding oil-rich province by the same name. The SOHR relies on a network of sources inside Syria to gather its information on the five-year conflict which has killed more than 280000 people and displaced millions. It says it determines whether strikes were carried out by Syrian Russian or US-led coalition aircraft based on the location of the raids flight patterns and the types of planes and munitions involved. Russia began carrying out strikes in Syria in September 2015 one year after the United States began its air campaign there. Regime air raids killed at least 15 civilians in the IS-held area of Boleel outside Deir az-Zour city on Friday. Read Also"

At least 15 civilians including three children have been killed in northern Syria in US airstrikes purportedly targeting ISIS positions in the Arab country a report says. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said Wednesday that the attacks had occurred in the city of Manbij in Aleppo Province during the past 24 hours. The airstrikes came a day after the White house said the US government was following up on press reports about alleged Russian airstrikes in Syria with civilian casualties. The observatory and the Reuters news agency said on Tuesday that at least 23 people had been killed in Russian airstrikes in the militant-held city of Idlib including one near a hospital. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov denied the reports. We urge people to remain critical of any horror stories spread by the British tandem of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Reuters news agency he said. Elsewhere in northern Syria thousands of troops from a Kurdish-Arab alliance are launching an attack to capture from Daesh a crucial swathe of the region known as the Manbij pocket following weeks of quiet preparations US officials told Reuters. The Pentagon has reportedly deployed more than 200 special forces troops alongside the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a coalition of Kurdish Arab Assyrian Armenian and Turkmen fighters. The Observatory said that the forces captured16 villages from Daesh and advanced to within nine miles on Manbij. Meanwhile Turkish military forces shelled northern Syria claiming to have targeted positions of the ISIS Takfiri terrorist group in the war-torn Arab country. The Turkish General Staff said in a statement on Wednesday that at least 14 members of the terrorist group were killed during the shelling on the city of Aleppo. The state-run Anadolu Agency citing military officials said Wednesday the strikes destroyed a tank two mortar positions a building used as headquarters and three vehicles belonging to the terrorists. The report which could not be independently verified said the air raids came after Turkeys military had determined that Daesh militants were preparing to attack the Turkish territory from the region. Cross-border fire from Syria has claimed 21 lives and wounded dozens of others in the border town of Kilis south central Turkey this year. Turkey itself stands accused of supporting Takfiri militants in Syria. Al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front and other Takfiri terrorists hold most of the northwestern province of Idlib and parts of neighboring Aleppo province. On Sunday Associated Press said Nusra Front has used a March ceasefire to recruit thousands of militants including teenagers who had used the Turkish border to slip into Syria. It is illustrating how the ceasefire put in place by Russia and the United States to weaken the militants has in many ways backfired the news agency said. Since March Nusra Front has recruited 3000 new militants including teenagers in comparison to an average of 200 to 300 a month before AP quoted SOHR as saying. Other sources said hundreds living in camps for displaced people in the northern parts near Turkey have joined the al-Qaeda branch Press TV reported. 212

A police source in the city said the initial toll also included 55 injured. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 14 were killed in the blast adding the number was expected to rise with many of the wounded in critical condition. The city is mainly in the hands of the PKKs Syrian wing the YPG after it evicted the Syrian regime army last August and leaving them with a symbolic foothold in a security zone in the center of the city. The YPG have expanded their control of the city despite the bombing of several locations by Syrian jets. Thousands of civilians in the ethnically mixed city including members of the Christian community have fled to villages in the countryside as the fighting intensified. Hasakahs population swelled by displaced Syrians fleeing areas that fell under Daish control is broadly divided along ethnic lines with Kurds mainly in the citys eastern neighborhoods and Arabs in the southern parts. Ankara has frequently voiced its concern over YPG activity along the Turkish border and has been rigid in its stance to not allow the PYD militant group to found any de facto Kurdish state in northern Syria. Turkey claims the PYD enjoys close connections with the PKK terrorist organization including militant and ammunition support through underground tunnels.

Tags Aleppo civil defence UN airstrikes Russia Airstrikes in opposition areas of Syrias northern Aleppo province struck a market a hospital and a village on Friday killing at least 18 people including children and two hospital staffers. The air raids hit the only hospital for women and children in the town of Kafr Hamra before dawn killing two staffers including a nurse. The Syrian Civil Defence a group of first responders said it pulled 10 people alive from under the rubble. Kafr Hamra is near the northern front line in the deeply divided city of Aleppo where government troops have sealed the main route into opposition areas effectively trapping nearly 300000 residents. The Syrian Civil Defence said one of its centres in the rebel-held part of Aleppo was hit. Pictures on the groups Facebook page showed serious damage to one of its vehicles and crumbling walls. The volunteer group said one of its most well-known members died after being buried under the rubble following a Wednesday airstrike in the Ramouseh area recently seized by rebels from government forces. Khaled Harah had recovered a live baby from a destroyed building in Aleppos Sukkari neighbourhood in 2014 following a 16-hour rescue effort. ""It was a miracle"" said Bibars Mishal a colleague of Harah in Aleppo. Harah was later invited to the UN Security Council to testify about the violence in Aleppo. Mishal said Harahs body was pulled from the rubble on Thursday.

That road remains under fire and the UN has asked for a cease-fire to allow aid into the area. Health facilities have been frequently targeted in the civil war in Syria. Aid groups have said the month of July was one of the worst since the war began in 2011 with some 43 facilities in opposition areas partially or totally destroyed. Despite calls for a ceasefire and Russias promise of a three-hour daily respite from airstrikes to allow in humanitarian aid there has been no let-up in the violence. During the day Friday airstrikes hit a market in the nearby town of Urem al-Kubra killing at least six people according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which relies on activists on the ground. Urem al-Kubra lies on the road linking Aleppo to the northern rebel-controlled province of Idlib which has also seen intense bombing. In the northern Aleppo countryside at least 10 people were killed including children and women when airstrikes hit the village of Hayan. It was not clear what the target was but videos shared by activists of the scene of the attack show the bodies of women and children strewn on the side of the road as frantic residents scramble to recover them. The Local Coordination Committees an activist collective said outdoor Friday prayers were called off in Idlib because of the intensity of the airstrikes. Germany meanwhile called for UN-supervised humanitarian access to Aleppo saying Russias unilateral three-hour daily cease-fire isnt enough. Russia has been carrying out airstrikes to bolster Syrian government forces since last September. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was quoted as telling Fridays edition of the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that ""humanitarian access cant be under the single-handed control of one side of the conflict."" ""A unilaterally declared three-hour cease-fire per day isnt enough to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe"" he said. Read Also"

The notorious ISIL terrorists have brutally massacred 250 Syrian troops taken hostage at an airbase in the northern province of Raqqa reports indicate. The killings the video of which was published on the internet took place on Wednesday at Tabqa airbase which was overran by the ISIL Takfiri terrorists. Rami Abdel Rahman the head of the London-based so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said on Thursday that Syrian soldiers captured while fleeing after the ISIL terrorists overran Tabqa airbase were executed by the terrorists during the night. The base is located some 45 kilometers outside Raqqa and reportedly holds several planes helicopters tanks and artillery. ISIL militants operating against the Syrian government have committed numerous mass executions during the ongoing conflict. Since the outbreak of crisis in Syria in March 2011 several video clips have been released showing the grisly crimes perpetrated by the Takfiri terrorists against innocent civilians in the crisis-torn country. ISIL terrorists have been behind many of the deadly bomb attacks targeting both civilians and government institutions across Syria over the past three years. The ISIL violence has spilled over to neighboring Iraq. The terrorist group has links with Saudi intelligence and is believed to be indirectly supported by the Israeli regime. MBMB

According to the statement UNICEF continues to provide treatment and medical facilities in the area of the attack as well as to cooperate with health partners ""to raise awareness about medical response to chemical attacks."" ""At least 27 children were confirmed killed in the attack in Idlib northwest of Syria A further 546 people among them many children have been injured. Casualty figures are expected to rise"" the statement read. On Tuesday Syrian opposition forces stated that some 80 people were killed and 200 injured in a chemical weapon attack in the Syrian Idlib province blaming the Syrian army for the incident. A source in the Syrian army later told Sputnik that the army did not have chemical weapons and the allegations could be part of anti-Damascus propaganda. The United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have launched an investigation into the incident. In 2013 Syria joined the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons after a chemical weapon attack in Syrian East Ghouta. In January 2016 the OPCW announced that all chemical weapons in Syria had been destroyed. However in June 2016 the US State Department released a report stating that Syria continues to use chemical substances against citizens and can also stockpile chemical weapons."

__label__1	"__topic__2 At least 8 White Helmets rescuers killed in airstrike in Syrias Hama Published April 29 2017 Airstrikes struck a center of Syrias rescuers known as the White Helmets in an opposition-held area in the countrys center killing eight volunteers opposition activists said Saturday. The airstrike was one of the deadliest against the rescuers who operate in opposition-held areas and who have garnered world attention for operating in extreme conditions pulling survivors out of recently struck areas. The volunteers have often been targeted by Assad regime airstrikes in what are known as double tap attacks as they work to rescue others. The local White Helmets in the central Hama province said an air raid on one of their centers in Kfar Zeita killed eight members of the team. The group said five bodies were lifted from the rubble and the rescuers continued to look for the others. The Britain-based opposition monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the number of those killed is likely to rise as the search regime and Russia aircraft have targeted opposition-held areas. The central Hama province have been scene to intense violence in recent weeks as the regime attempts to push back an opposition offensive. Separately Saturday regime army said its troops and allied fighters repelled an attack by Daesh terrorist group on a strategic area held by the regime in southern Aleppo province. The attack took place in Khanaser southeast Aleppo a strategic region that links Aleppo with central and western Syria. The area has changed hands many times during the conflict. But last year regime forces and allied fighters wrested control of Khanaser from Daesh. The military media arm said Daesh attacked Um Mayyal village near a mountain range in Khanaser and other areas. The Observatory said Daesh fighters launched the attack on military posts in the area triggering intense clashes and leaving many casualties. Daesh-affiliated Aamaq news agency claimed Daesh fighters killed 30 regime soldiers in the attack. Near the capital hundreds of Syrians from the oppositon-held suburbs of eastern Ghouta near Damascus protested against infighting between the insurgent groups that began Friday and left dozens killed in the area. The infighting came amid an intensified regime offensive in the area near Damascus which the opposition fighters have controlled for years but has been increasingly squeezed by regime advances. ""God rid us of all leaders"" the protesters chanted criticizing the head of the insurgent groups for diverting their weapons from the front line with the regime. The infighting is pitting the powerful Army of Islam group against al-Rahman Corps and al-Qaida-linked group the Levant Liberation Committee or Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. Each side blames the other for triggering the fighting in the power struggle over control of eastern Ghouta. Some activists have called on Army of Islam to rid eastern Ghouta of the powerful al-Qaida-linked group. The Observatory said shots were fired at the protesters in one area leaving five injured. In 24 hours of fighting the Observatory said at least 38 opposition fighters from the warring sides were killed. Damascus-based Shaam News Network put the number at 60 in addition to six civilians killed because of the clashes. For the past three years the regime has been unable to regain control of the eastern suburbs of Damascus. But in recent weeks an intensified offensive points to a new determination to retake the area. On Saturday activists reported a heavy air campaign against the areas Qaboun neighborhood."

""There are at least 56 dead including 11 children and dozens more wounded including some in critical condition"" said Rami Abdel Rahman director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The monitor said that the civilians were hit as they were fleeing fighting in the Aleppo province village of Al-Tukhar and that they had apparently been mistaken for IS group fighters. The Observatory - which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information - says it determines what planes carried out raids according to their type location flight patterns and the munitions involved. Asked about the incident the coalition had no immediate comment but said it was looking into the reports. Al-Tukhar lies 14 kilometres (nine miles) north of the town of Manbij a key IS group stronghold that has been repeatedly targeted in raids by the US-led coalition. On Monday the Observatory said 21 civilians had been killed in coalition raids in the area 15 in a northern district of Manbij and another six in Al-Tukhar. Manbij sits on ISs main supply route between Syria and neighbouring Turkey and has been the target of a US-backed offensive by a Kurdish-Arab alliance of fighters since May 31. In June the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance broke into western districts of the town but their advance has been slowed in the past month because of landmines planted by the jihadists and ongoing suicide attacks. Near Aleppo government forces sought to tighten their siege of rebel-held districts of the battleground second city. Clashes erupted around Handarat a largely deserted Palestinian refugee camp north of the city after government forces seized parts of the only remaining supply route into rebel-held eastern districts effectively severing them from the outside world. The capture of the Castello Road has raised fears of a lengthy siege of east Aleppo where residents have already reported food shortages and rising prices. The Observatory said fierce clashes were underway around Handarat Camp which is less than two kilometres (barely a mile) from the northern outskirts of the city. ""If the regime takes Handarat it will be able to completely asphyxiate the rebels in east Aleppo and they will be unable to launch counter-attacks to retake the Castello Road"" Abdel Rahman told AFP. Analysts have warned that the government advances around Aleppo could be ""devastating"" for the rebels. And the United Nations has raised concern about the fate of the more then 200000 people still living in rebel-held districts. It said relief supplies had already been stockpiled in the city but ""further life-saving aid is needed urgently."""

A boy who was injured during a bomb blast on a crowded Syrian bus convoy outside Aleppo on Saturday sits inside a tent connected to Bab al-Hawa hospital near the Syrian-Turkish border Syria April 18 2017 (File photo) (TRT World and Agencies) A bomb killed six people and wounded more than 30 in Syrias second city Aleppo on Wednesday the Assad regimes official television channel reported. The blast hit the southwestern neighbourhood of Salaheddin which was on the front line between opposition and regime-held sectors before Bashar al Assads forces retook full control of the city in December. The attack took place as evacuations of civilians from conflict zones resumed after a four-day pause. About 45 buses carrying 3000 people left the opposition-besieged al-Foua and Kefraya towns of the northwestern Idlib province for regime-controlled Aleppo. Meanwhile a convoy of 11 buses left regime-besieged al-Zabadani near the capital Damascus for opposition-controlled territory a military media unit linked to the pro-regime Hezbollah group said. ""The area of Zabadani is empty of militants after the last batch of them left this morning"" the pro-regime Sham FM radio reported citing a senior regime official in Zabadani. Three buses on Wednesday also carried people who were injured in a convoy attack as they were being transferred from al-Foua and Kefraya on Saturday as well as the remains of those who had died in the attack the Hezbollah military media unit said. Saturdays convoy attack killed 126 people including more than 60 children the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The convoy was carrying at least 5000 people including civilians and several hundred pro-regime fighters who were granted safe passage out of the two towns. The attack forced a population exchange deal brokered by regime ally Iran and opposition backer Qatar to be halted. Under the deal more than 30000 people will be evacuated from four Syrian towns in two stages. Source TRTWorld and agencies"

__label__1	__topic__2 World leaders react to Syria chemical attack claim Wednesday 21 August 2013 World leaders react to Syria chemical attack claim. World leaders have responded to the claim by activists in the Syrian Revolution General Commission that at least 640 people were killed in a nerve gas attack on Syrias Ghouta region. The Arab League called Wednesday on U.N. chemical weapons inspectors now inside Syria to immediately visit the site of the incident. Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi urged the inspectors in a statement to go immediately to Eastern Ghouta to see the reality of the situation and investigate the circumstances of this crime. Britain said on Wednesday it would raise a reported chemical weapons attack by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at the United Nations Security Council and called on Damascus to give U.N. inspectors access to the site Reuters reported. I am deeply concerned by reports that hundreds of people including children have been killed in airstrikes and a chemical weapons attack on rebel-held areas near Damascus British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. France also called for action by the U.N. during a cabinet session Hollande announced his intention to ask the U.N. to visit the site of the attack government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem told reporters on Wednesday. This information obviously requires verification and confirmation she added. The chief of a U.N. inspectors team visiting Syria says he wants to look into the claims. Swedish chemical weapons expert Ake Sellstrom says the high numbers of killed and wounded being reported sound suspicious. He told Swedish broadcaster SVT that this sounds like something we need to look into. Turkey also called on U.N. inspectors to look into Syrian rebel reports and said it was monitoring the situation with great concern. Light must immediately be shed on these claims and the United Nations mission that was formed to investigate chemical weapons claims in Syria should look into these claims and reveal its findings the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. If these allegations are found to be true it will be inevitable for the international community to take the necessary stance and give the necessary response to this savagery and crime against humanity it said. The opposition Syrian National Coalition called for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting on the subject. I call on the Security Council to convene urgently National Coalition leader Ahmed al-Jarba told Al-Arabiya news channel condemning the Syrian armys bombardment of the Ghouta suburbs of Damascus as a massacre. The attack was on rebel-held areas of eastern Damascus. Regime forces ... stepped up military operations in the Eastern Ghouta and Western Ghouta zones of the Damascus region with aircraft and rocket launchers causing several dozen dead and wounded the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told AFP news agency. The intensive bombing on the outskirts of the capital could be heard by residents of Damascus where a grey cloud capped the sky. The Britain-based Observatory which relies on a vast network of activists on the ground and medics said the army operation was aimed at the recapture of Madhamiyat el-Sham an area southwest of Damascus. The Local Coordination Committees (LCC) a network of activists reported hundreds of casualties in the brutal use of toxic gas by the criminal regime in parts of Western Ghouta. According to Reuters the reported use of the chemical agents could not be immediately verified. The news coincides with a visit to Damascus by a United Nations team of chemical weapons experts.

__label__0	__topic__2 Airstrikes kill 28 civilians in Syria safe zone monitor Date of publication 30 September 2017 Four children are among the 28 dead in overnight airstrikes on the town of Armanaz in Idlib province purportedly carried out by Syrian regime or Russian jets. Tags Syria Russia Idlib safe zone Turkey Assad SOHR At least 28 civilians were killed in airstrikes on northwestern Syria despite a planned safe zone. Four children were among the dead in the overnight strikes on the town of Armanaz in Idlib province near the Turkish border the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based watchdog had earlier reported 12 dead in the strikes on the town in Harem district around 20 kilometres northwest of the provincial capital Idlib. Entire apartment blocks had been flattened by the bombardment an AFP correspondent said. The Observatory said it could not immediately determine whether the strikes had been carried out by jets of the Syrian regime or its ally Russia. But they are the latest in an intensifying air campaign carried out by the two governments against jihadist fighters who control most of the province and are not party to a safe zone deal brokered by Russia Turkey and Iran. The surge in bombing raids has forced hospitals in the province to close medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Friday. They were triggered by an offensive by jihadist fighters led by al-Qaedas former Syria affiliate launched against regime-held villages in neighbouring Hama province on September 19. The jihadists control nearly all of Idlib province after driving out Islamist former allies earlier this year. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed on Thursday to step up efforts to establish a safe zone in Idlib as part of a wider agreement struck in May. Three other safe zones have already been set up - in Eastern Ghouta near Damascus parts of the south and some areas of the central province of Homs. But in some of those areas too the fighting has continued. Shelling by the army killed at least 21 civilians in Eastern Ghouta on Saturday more than half of them children the Observatory said. The de-escalation agreement excludes both the Islamic State group and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham the alliance dominated by al-Qaedas former Syrian affiliate. The Islamic State group is under attack in its remaining strongholds in eastern Syria by both Russian-backed government forces and US-backed fighters. On Thursday it mounted a counterattack against government forces along their supply lines through the desert to the eastern city of Deir Ezzor. At least 128 troops and militia were killed on Thursday and Friday as the army battled to restore control the Observatory said. State media have reported the IS counterattack but have made no mention of the armys losses. Read Also

A bomb attack in northwest Syria killed three people on Sunday including a journalist working for a publication of the ruling Baath party state-run news agency SANA said. The agency reported the killing of Fakhreddine Hassan a journalist for the Baath partys youth publication.

At least 23 ISIS (Daesh) militants have been killed by Turkish artillery fire and US airstrikes in northern Syria a Turkish broadcaster claims. As many as 33 targets were hit in the joint operation which was carried out against militants preparing for an attack on Turkey Haberturk reported on Monday. Cross-border artillery fire by Turkish troops destroyed at least six weapon caches and one armed vehicle it said. The Turkish military has repeatedly targeted northern Syria with artillery shells guided missiles and mortars to hit militants who Ankara says have fired rockets at southern Turkish border towns. There have also been reports of operations by Turkeys Special Forces inside the Syrian territory. Turkey has also hinted at establishing a safe zone in the 98-kilometer (60-mile) stretch between Manbij in Aleppo Province and the Turkish border prompting objections from Iran and Russia. The US has supported the plan describing it as part of a deepening campaign by the Turkish army to push ISIS away from a vital 60-mile stretch of the Turkey-Syria border that serves as the groups main lifeline. Turkey and the US however do not see eye to eye on Washingtons support for Kurdish militants in northern Syria. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said last week Turkey would not allow cooperation with terrorist organizations in Syria referring to Kurdish groups which the US supports. Turkey says the fighters are a terrorist organization affiliated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) but the US sees them as a partner in Syria operations. In a speech to his ruling AK Party in parliament last Tuesday Yildirim said Turkey wont allow formation of new states in Syria echoing suspicion that the Kurdish campaign was aimed at establishing a separate state.

Many pointed their fingers at the Syrian regime which denied any responsibility for the attack and described the massacre as fabricated fake accusations by the armed fighters. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attack believed to have been carried out by Syrian regime or Russian jets killed at least 58 people including 11 children at ages below 8. The Observatory added that warplanes continued to bomb the town following the attack which took place near a medical center where the victims of the first aggression were being treated. The attack also caused many people to choke and some to foam at the mouth the Observatory added. A high-ranking Syrian opposition official told Asharq Al-Awsat that the gas used during Tuesdays massacre had never been used before. Director of Levant Institute for Strategic Affairs (LISA) Sami Nader said. This crime will constitute a turning point in the Syrian developments because it has embarrassed the Russians on the issue of chemicals. Meanwhile the National Coalition for Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces said the attack killed more than 100 people including 25 children and 15 women and injured 400 others. A military source at the Free Syrian Army told Asharq Al-Awsat that the attack targeted a popular market in the center of Khan Sheikhoun. The attack only targeted civilians in order to push the residents of Idlib and its suburbs to migrate outside the Syrian border the source asserted. While UN war crimes investigators are looking into the alleged chemical weapons attack on the Syrian town in Idlib the Security Council is expected to hold a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the matter. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it is seriously concerned about the attack. It said its Fact Finding Mission (FFM) is in the process of gathering and analyzing information from all available sources. Several countries also condemned the attack. The White House considered it as unacceptable while US President Donald Trump said These heinous actions by the Bashar Assad regime are a consequence of the past administrations weakness and irresolution.For his part French President Francois Hollande directly blamed Syrian regime forces for the attack while High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini said the regime of Assad bears primary responsibility.Commenting on what happened in Khan Sheikhoun UN special envoy for Syria Staffa de Mistura said This was horrific im sure there will be a Security Council meeting on this for clear identification of responsibilities accountability.

Videos and images posted by opposition supporters online showed a massive plume of smoke and earth shooting into the air near a small town as men shouted ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest). Rebels fighting to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad regularly carry out guerrilla attacks against his forces but the size of the blast which occurred on Monday was unusual. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitoring group said the blast took place outside the town of Maarat al-Numan in the northwestern Idlib province. At least two officers were among those killed when insurgents from the Islamic Front and the Shields of the Revolution Council set off tonnes of explosives in a tunnel running from the road to the checkpoint the group said. More than 150000 people have been killed in the three-year-old rebellion which started as a peaceful protest movement and turned into a civil war after a government crackdown. International powers have been deadlocked over how to resolve the conflict further complicated by infighting between rebel groups that has killed thousands of fighters this year. On Monday about 70 rebels were killed in clashes between a former al Qaeda affiliate the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and al Qaedas Syrian branch the Nusra Front and its allies in an eastern province bordering Iraq the Observatory said. The fighting which has intensified in the last few weeks centres around villages on the outskirts of the city of Deir al-Zor capital of the oil-producing province of the same name where rebel groups have been fighting each other for control of oilfields and strategic areas. The latest clashes has displaced tens of thousands of people in the area over the last few days the Observatory said. Five civilians were killed in Mondays fighting which resulted in the Nusra Front and its allies taking control of the village of al-Sabha it said."

__label__0	__topic__2 Russia says it kills 180 extremists mercenaries in Syria claims Shishani_s death | Jordan Times Last updated at Oct 082017 MOSCOW Some 120 Daesh terror group extremists and 60 foreign mercenaries were killed in a series of Russian air strikes in Syria over the past 24 hours the defence ministry in Moscow said on Saturday. Puzzlingly the ministry also said three senior Daesh commanders including Omar Al Shishani had been confirmed dead as a result of an earlier Russian strike. Moscow reported Shishanis death despite the fact that the Pentagon said in 2016 the notorious fighter had been killed by American troops in Iraq. A command post of the terrorists and up to 80 [Daesh] fighters including nine natives of the Northern Caucasus were destroyed in the area of Mayadeen the ministry said adding that another 40 Daesh fighters were killed around the town of Albu Kamal. Mayadeen is one of Daeshs last bastions in Syria. In another air strike more than 60 foreign mercenaries from the former Soviet Union Tunisia and Egypt were killed in the Euphrates Valley south of Deir Ezzor. The ministry said large numbers of foreign mercenaries were coming into the Syrian border town of Albu Kamal from Iraq. It also said Russian forces had killed senior Daesh commanders Omar Al Shishani Alaa Al Din Al Shishani and Salah Al Din Al Shishani all natives of the Northern Caucasus. Moscow reported their deaths after taking several days to confirm the results of an earlier strike on the northern outskirts of Albu Kamal which destroyed a Daesh command post with more than 30 fighters including the natives of the Northern Caucasus. Omar the Chechen The Pentagon announced in March 2016 that American forces had killed Shishani one of the most notorious faces of Daesh known for his thick red beard. Shishani whose nom de guerre means Omar the Chechen came from the former Soviet state of Georgias Pankisi Gorge region which is populated mainly by ethnic Chechens. He fought as a Chechen rebel against Russian forces before joining the Georgian military in 2006 and fought Russian forces again in Georgia in 2008. He later resurfaced in northern Syria as the commander of a group of foreign fighters and became a senior leader within Daesh. The Russian defence ministry was not immediately available for further comment. Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights disagreed with Moscows report. Salah Al Din Al Shishani is still alive and is somewhere in the regions controlled by extremist groups in the west of Aleppo province. He is a famous commander and his extremist group is allied with the extremists of Al Nusra Front but only in their fight against the regime he said. He has no links with Daesh The advances against Daesh in Deir Ezzor have resulted in a heavy civilian death toll through Russian and coalition air raids. The observatory said Russian air strikes on Thursday night killed 14 people including three children fleeing across the Euphrates on rafts near Mayadeen. Since it intervened in Syria in 2015 Russia has not acknowledged any civilian deaths from its strikes and it dismisses the observatorys reporting as biased. Moscow has been staging air strikes in support of its ally Damascus targeting both Daesh in Deir Ezzor province and rival extremists led by Al Qaedas former Syria affiliate in Idlib province in the northwest.

Groups of men some wearing the white helmets of civil defence volunteers trudged through the rubble. More than 35 homes were destroyed the Observatory said. Once Syrias commercial hub Aleppo is divided between rebel groups entrenched in the east and government troops in the western neighbourhoods. It has suffered devastating damage as each side tries to dislodge the other. Rights groups have criticised both sides for indiscriminate attacks on civilians including with the regimes notorious barrel bombs. The Observatory said running water was restored Tuesday in Aleppo after a cut of more than three weeks apparently after an understanding between the regime and Al-Qaedas affiliate in Syria Al-Nusra Front. Al-Nusra which controls the pumping station in a rebel-held district had cut off supplies to pressure the government to restore electricity to areas under its control. The rebels turned the water back on after the regime caved in and restored electricity supplies according to the Observatory. Elsewhere in the war-battered country the Syrian army and its allies from Lebanons Shiite militia Hezbollah captured more territory inside Zabadani the last rebel-held town on the two countries border the Observatory said. They seized the Sahel district driving out the rebels under heavy bombardment. The two-week-old battle for Zabadani has cost the lives of at least 63 rebels and 21 Hezbollah fighters according to the Observatory which has not given a toll for the army. Syrias conflict which began in 2011 with anti-government protests has degenerated into a multi-front civil war that has killed more than 230000 people."

__label__1	"__topic__2 Syria army plane crashes in rebel-held town 3 August 2015 A Syrian military aircraft crashed while on a bombing run over the rebel-held northwestern town of Ariha on Monday leaving at least 27 people dead a monitoring group said. Tags Syria Idlib Ariha Assad war Government air raids in a northwestern town in Syria and a subsequent crash by a Syrian warplane that slammed into a residential area there killed at least 27 people on Monday activists said. The raids on the town of Ariha came amid intense clashes between government forces and insurgents in the northwestern province of Idlib and the central region of Hama. The town once a government stronghold was captured by opposition fighters and Islamic militants in May. Government forces have suffered setbacks in Idlib province since March including the loss of the provincial capital of the same name. An activist group known as the Local Coordination Committees said the warplane crashed in a busy market adding that it was not immediately clear whether it was shot down. The LCC said 27 people were killed and many others were wounded. Rami Abdurrahman who heads another activist group the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the plane crashed in the town centre destroying several homes. The Observatory later said that 31 people were killed and more than 60 were wounded. The Ariha Today Facebook page posted a photo showing at least seven buildings reduced to rubble on a narrow street. It said 27 people were killed but that 12 of them have not been identified yet. The group also listed 55 wounded including nine women. The discrepancies in the different casualty figures reported could not be reconciled. The Observatory and the LCC said that at the time of the crash the town was under attack by Syrian President Bashar Assads air force. An amateur video posted online by activists showed several damaged buildings as well as parts of the plane that crashed. Syrias civil war began in March 2011. The United Nations says the war has killed more than 220000 people wounded at least one million and left many displaced internally and in neighbouring countries. 	 	More than four million Syrians have fled the civil war to become refugees in the surrounding region"
