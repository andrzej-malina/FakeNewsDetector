A picture taken on July 29 2016 shows a close up view of Karaj al-Hajz corridor (C) a passage in rebel-held Aleppo leading towards the Syrian government controlled area of Masharqa neighbourhood. (TRT World and Agencies) At least 15 civilians were killed and many wounded in fresh air strikes by US-led coalition in Syria on Thursday morning. These civilians were targeted in the coalition jets bombardment in the town of Ghandoura said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. US Central Command which oversees US military operations in the Middle East said it had ""initiated an assessment following internal operational reporting that a strike today near Manbij Syria may have resulted in civilian casualties."" The strikes came a day after the coalition opened a formal investigation to determine whether its air strikes last week near Manbij claimed more than 100 civilian lives including children. US-led coalition continue to target civilians in Syria (Reuters) Around 600 Syrians including 136 children have been killed in coalition air strikes since September 2014 according to an Observatory toll. More than 520 US airstrikes since 21 May have killed between 229 and 425 civilians overall. After examining ""internal and external information"" the coalition determined that there was sufficient credible evidence of civilian victims to open a formal inquiry said spokesman Colonel Chris Garver on Wednesday. The main Syrian opposition group had urged the US-led coalition to suspend its bombardments following the strikes. Amnesty International has also called on the coalition to redouble its efforts to prevent civilian deaths and to investigate possible violations of international humanitarian law.

__label__1	__topic__2 U.N. inspectors to visit Syria chemical attacks sites Thursday 1 August 2013 U.N. inspectors to visit Syria chemical attacks sites. U.N. inspectors will go to Syria to investigate three sites where chemical weapons attacks have been reported the United Nations said Wednesday. The Syrian government has blocked the inspectors since calling for a U.N. inquiry into the use of the banned arms in March. The mission will travel to Syria as soon as possible to contemporaneously investigate three of the reported incidents said U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky. The announcement followed an accord reached with the Syrian government when two U.N. envoys went to Damascus last week. According to diplomats the inspectors are being assembled in Europe now and could go to Syria as soon as next week. The U.N. says that Syria Britain France and the United States have informed it of 13 alleged chemical weapons attacks during the 28-month-old conflict. While the initial inquiry will focus on three sites Nesirky said U.N. leader Ban Ki-moon remains mindful of other reported incidents and the mission will also continue to seek clarification from the member states concerned. The spokesman said the first sites to be visited will include Khan al-Assal near the Syrian city of Aleppo where the government reported a chemical weapons attack on March 19. It said at least 26 people including 16 government soldiers were killed. The government and its ally Russia have blamed Syrian rebels for the attack. The Syrian opposition says President Bashar al-Assads forces staged the attack. The other two sites to be visited by the inspectors are Ataybah near Damascus where a suspected attack was staged in March and Homs where chemical weapons are alleged to have been used on December 23 diplomats said. Britain and France have submitted evidence to the United Nations on the Ataybah and Homs attacks which they say was carried out by the government. The Syrian government called for the U.N. inquiry in March. But it then blocked the U.N. inspectors insisting that they be limited to Khan al-Assal. Ban had demanded wider access for the investigation. Ake Sellstrom the Swedish expert in charge of the U.N. inquiry and U.N. High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Angela Kane went to Damascus last week to negotiate the access accord.

""The number of Al-Nusra Front and rebel fighters killed in battles (Saturday) against ISIL in the strategic town of Markada in the south of Hasake province has risen to 39"" said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The group said ISIL lost 13 of its fighters as it took total control of Markada. ""Markada is important because it provides ISIL with a supply route from Iraq into the road linking Hasake to Deir Ezzor"" said the Observatory. Oil-rich Hasake and Deir Ezzor provinces border Iraq where ISIL has its roots. ISIL has been fighting a war against rebels including the Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front since January across large swathes of western northern and eastern Syria. Once allied to ISIL Syrias rebels and Al-Nusra turned against the jihadists angered by their quest for hegemony and abuses. While ISIL has withdrawn from much of the west and north of Syria it has held its ground firmly in the east near the Iraqi border. On another front fighting raged in flashpoints of Latakia province on the Mediterranean coastline where rebels and Al-Nusra Front began a surprise offensive against the army last week. Latakia is the heartland of both President Bashar al-Assads clan and his Alawite sect. Since late last week the rebels have taken over a key border crossing with Turkey at Kasab and a handful of villages. On Sunday the fighting was focused around the village of Qustul Maaf and the Nisr mountain which is surrounded by rebels. The battle in Latakia has killed some 300 fighters on both sides the Observatory said including 180 army and paramilitary troops loyal to Assads regime. More than 146000 people have died in Syrias three-year war and nearly half the countrys population have fled their homes."

Tags Syria Russia Islamic State Deir az-Zour SDF US coalition A Russian airstrike killed at least 38 civilians on Wednesday as they attempted to cross the Euphrates River to escape fighting in eastern Syrias Deir az-Zour region a monitoring group said. Children were among those killed as they tried to cross the river aboard rafts to escape areas where the Syrian regime is fighting the Islamic State group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Backed by Russian airstrikes the forces of Syrias President Bashar Assad notorious for their indiscriminate targeting of civilians are pressing a battle to retake IS-controlled areas in the eastern province of Deir az-Zour. A US-led international coalition has been providing air support to a Kurdish-Arab alliance also fighting the militants in its former northern bastion of Raqqa city and Deir az-Zour. September was the deadliest month for Syrians this year with the ongoing war killing at least 3000 people including 955 civilians. The Observatory relies on a network of sources inside Syria and says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. The group has reported hundreds of civilians killed in operations against IS in Deir az-Zour and neighbouring Raqqa province where the SDF is fighting with US support to capture the former IS bastion of Raqqa. On Tuesday the Observatory said a US-led coalition strike in Raqqa killed at least 18 civilians. Russia has not acknowledged any civilian deaths in its strikes since it intervened in Syrias war in 2015 and dismisses the Observatorys reporting as biased. The deaths in Deir az-Zour on Wednesday prompted outrage from the opposition Syrian National Coalition which described the incident as a ""heinous crime"". 	 	 Read Also"

State news agency SANA said troops were able to destroy the vehicle rigged with explosives before it reached its target in Zahra. It added that troops repelled the attack killing and wounding dozens of insurgents in Zahra and other parts of Aleppo. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the suicide attack that was carried by members of the Nusra Front killed 25 troops and pro-government gunmen. The group added that 19 insurgents have been killed since Monday in Zahra. A former industrial and commercial hub Aleppo has been carved up between government and rebel-held neighbourhoods since July 2012. With Syrias largest city devastated by three years of fighting many of its residents have long fled. ""The city is witnessing fierce battles and the shelling is daily and intense"" said Aleppo-based activist Ibrahim Khatib via Skype. ""The situation is bad and residents are living through difficult humanitarian conditions."" Opposition fighters and Islamic militants have launched a series of attacks in Aleppo since last week capturing the citys Scientific Research Center that was used as a military base. Activists said Syrian troops and pro-government gunmen have been trying to retake the base with no luck so far. Chlorine gas The Local Coordination Committees and the observatory said government troops used chlorine gas on Tuesday during an attempt to regain control of the Scientific Research Center. The Observatorys chief Rami Abdurrahman said there were no casualties among the militants since most of them were wearing masks. The opposition and the government have blamed each other for chlorine gas attacks in the past. The fighting is part of a new coordinated offensive in Aleppo by a newly-formed coalition between the Nusra Front and other factions including the ultra-conservative Ahrar al-Sham group. The coalition which calls itself Ansar al-Sharia has said it seeks to ""liberate"" Aleppo.

The deal worth around $1 billion aims to fund imports of goods and commodities as well as other projects. Iran is President Bashar Assads strongest regional ally extending him billions of dollars in credit since the crisis began in March 2011. The United States Saudi Arabia and several countries in the Persian Gulf suspect Tehran is also shipping him weapons. In another development Syrian tribal leaders are in secret talks with UN special envoy for Syria and a senior US general to form a coalition similar to the so-called ""Sunni Awakening"" during the US occupation of Iraq according to The Independent. However in interviews with the UK newspaper the tribal leaders said they were wary of being exploited by external powers which they blamed for their countrys current situation. Syrias conflict has killed more than 230000 people and wounded at least a million according to the UN. Over half of Syrias prewar population of 22 million have been forced to leave their homes."

(AFP Photo) At least 18 civilians were killed on Tuesday when a ground-to-ground missile struck a rebel-held neighborhood in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo a monitoring group said. Another 50 were wounded or missing in the citys central neighborhood of Maghawir the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said blaming the attack on forces loyal to the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Aleppo Syrias largest city before it was engulfed by fighting in 2012 is divided between the Assad regime-held western districts and the rebel-held east. In the Qalamoun region west of the capital Damascus government forces backed by the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah seized areas outside Zabadani the last rebel-controlled town in the area. The Hezbollah said it had taken control of the plain outside the city and a main road in cooperation with the Syrian army. ""The city of Zabadani is under the full siege of the Syrian army and our resistance fighters"" the terrorist group said. Hezbollah is trying to eliminate rebel forces from all areas between the Lebanese border and Damascus. Zabadani lies 12 kilometers from the border crossing on the Damascus-Beirut highway and about 25 kilometers north-west of the Syrian capital. The Syrian conflict which started when the Assad regime forces brutally repressed peaceful protests in 2011 has descended into a multi-sided civil war. Forces loyal to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad are facing off against an array of rebel and terrorist groups and both sides are under attack from the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) group which now controls most of eastern Syrian territory. Syrias Kurds have carved out a de facto autonomous region named Rojava in the north of the country and are attacking ISIS with intensive U.S.-led air support."

The group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said an unidentified war plane had crashed in countryside south of Aleppo in an area where Islamist rebel fighters are battling the Syrian army and Iranian-backed forces. It had no information on what caused the crash. A civil defence worker said at least 32 people were killed in the rebel-held parts of the city during the air strikes with 18 bodies pulled from flattened buildings in the Qatrji neighbourhood the worst hit. The monitor said dozens of barrel bombs oil drums or cylinders packed with explosives and shrapnel were dropped by helicopter on densely populated districts. ""This week-long campaign of bombing is very intense and day by day its getting worse... it is the worst we have seen in a while"" said Bebars Mishal a civil defence official in rebel-held Aleppo. For their part rebels hit government-held areas of Aleppo in what Syrian media said was an escalation of mortar attacks on the western districts. State media said attacks on Sunday on Hamadaniyah Midan and other neighbourhoods by insurgents killed at least 20 people in the second day of intense shelling of government-held areas. The death toll over the whole weekend was at least 44. Aleppo the countrys largest city before the war has been divided for years between rebel and government-held zones. Full control of Aleppo would be a huge prize for President Bashar Assad. Russias military intervention since September has helped to bolster Assads government. In the northwestern province of Idlib meanwhile residents said Syrian and Russian jets bombed the rebel-held provincial capital setting fire to a bustling market in the heart of the city. More than 30 people were injured at least three killed and dozens were unaccounted for according to an activist contacted in the city. The Idlib strikes came just days after some of the heaviest raids on residential areas for months killing more than 30 people and injuring dozens on May 31. Idlib has been a relative haven for thousands of displaced Syrians. The air raids in Aleppo on Sunday came in the wake of strikes on civilian areas on Friday that residents said were the most intense in over a month. The Syrian Observatory said the Syrian government raids had targeted the main Castello road that leads into rebel-held Aleppo as part of a campaign to complete the encirclement of the citys insurgent-dominated areas. A Russian defence ministry statement on Sunday accused militant Syrian rebel groups of firing mortars on the mainly Kurdish-populated Sheikh Maqsood neighbourhood in Aleppo that overlooks the Castello road. The monitor said 13 people including six children were killed on Saturday in the Kurdish-run area by insurgents mortars. Rebels accuse the powerful Kurdish YPG of working with the Syrian army to cut the main artery by intensifying their ground attacks on the highway. The Russians had on Saturday accused militants from radical Islamic groups of bringing at least 1000 fighters into an area in the southern Aleppo countryside. The militants have consolidated gains since Friday in the area around the strategic town of Khan Touman rebels say. The Nusra Front spearheaded an attack on Khan Touman last month delivering one of the biggest battlefield setbacks yet to a coalition of foreign Shiite fighters supporting Syrian government forces. Rebels say Russian jets on Sunday pounded insurgent positions in the area to prevent them from advancing towards the nearby town of Hader which rebels say is a stronghold of Iranian-backed militias. Also US-backed forces on Sunday engaged with the Daesh terror groups militants in an offensive that began last Tuesday against the group-held areas in Aleppo province beginning with the Manbij area where they continued to seize more villages according to Kurdish sources and the monitor."

The U.N. health agency said the casualties occurred between Nov. 14 to Nov. 17 in clashes between opposition fighters and forces that support the Assad regime in the eastern Ghouta region. The area on the outskirts of Damascus has been under a regime siege for more than four years. Seventeen children and six women were among those killed. The agency also said in a statement Wednesday that more than 200 operations were conducted in eastern Ghouta despite blockages that have prevented deliveries of humanitarian aid including life-saving medicines medical equipment and surgical supplies. Elizabeth Hoff WHOs Representative in Syria said medical evacuations of critically-ill patients are ""long overdue."" Civil-defense units reportedly rushed to the scene of the attacks to treat the injured and transport them to lcoal hospitals. Regime forces have recently stepped up their attacks on Eastern Ghouta even though the district falls within a network of de-escalation zones - endorsed by Turkey Russia and Iran - in which acts of aggression are prohibited. Over the course of the past week regime forces have carried out repeated attacks on the district leaving dozens of civilian residents dead or injured. Syria has only just begun to emerge from a devastating civil war that began in early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity. Since then hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the fighting and more than 10 million have been displaced according to to the U.N."

A suicide bomb blast killed at least 16 people in the mostly Kurdish-controlled city of Hasaka in northeastern Syria on Tuesday the monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The attacker detonated his explosives at a bakery. The British-based observatory said several other people were wounded and the death toll was likely to rise because of the number of serious injuries. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing. Islamic State has targeted areas of Hasaka province in the past including another city Qamishli. But bomb attacks in Hasaka city itself have been rarer in recent months. The Kurdish YPG militia which controls most of Hasaka province captured large areas of territory from Islamic State in northeastern Syria last year and is involved in a U.S.-backed offensive against the jihadists further west near the Turkish border. --Reuters

Most of the deaths were in the village of Oweijel just west of the city of Aleppo where at least 23 people were killed in an airstrike that also wounded dozens according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Another monitoring group the Local Coordination Committees said the air raid was carried out by Russian warplanes and put the death toll at 30. More than a dozen people were also killed in a besieged eastern opposition-held neighborhood in Aleppo. The eastern parts of the city Syrias largest have been subjected in recent weeks to the worst aerial attacks in years. The airstrikes have claimed hundreds of lives wounded many others and demolished entire buildings. Opposition activists have blamed Russian and Syrian government warplanes for the strikes. The Observatory said Mondays airstrikes hit in the Marjeh neighborhood. The Aleppo Media Center an activist collective said those killed included 11 people with the same family name of Qabs ranging from a month-and-a-half-old baby girl to a 25-year-old man. Mondays airstrikes coincided with the launch in neighboring Iraq of a major operation by Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by the U.S.-led coalition to retake the city of Mosul from Daesh. There have been concerns the government in Damascus could use the timing of the Mosul offensive to press its onslaught in Aleppo while world attention is diverted to developments in Iraq. Also Monday Syrian state media claimed 49 oppostion fighters were killed and wounded in fighting in the neighborhoods of Sheikh Saeed and Shurfa on the southern edges of Aleppo. In the nearby province of Idlib a U.S.-led coalition drone struck a car in the provincial capital that carries the same name killing all inside according to the Observatory official. It was not immediately clear who was in the vehicle but such attacks have previously targeted officials with al-Qaidas affiliate in Syria known as Fatah al-Sham Front. The Observatory said the attack targeted a faction commander. An official with Fatah al-Sham Front formerly known as Nusra Front said all those in the car were ""martyred."" The man who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media said it was not clear if members of his group were targeted. Earlier this month a drone attack killed top al-Qaida official Ahmed Salama Mabrouk. The United States and Britain on Sunday acknowledged the Western worlds weak support for any military action against Syrias government as they seek ways to pressure Syrian regime leader Bashar Assad and his chief backer Russia to halt the deadly Aleppo offensive. After a meeting of 11 governments opposing Assads rule U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson each insisted that all options were on the table. But their stark explanations about the danger of resorting to military force appeared to rule out such a move. The government in Damascus meanwhile appears to be trying to improve relations with Egypt the Arab worlds most populous nation following the first public meeting between Egyptian and Syrian security chiefs. Maj. Gen. Ali Mamlouk head of the National Security Bureau and one of Assads top aides visited Cairo Sunday at the head of a delegation to coordinate with Egypt in the fight against ""terrorism"" in the region Syrias state-run news agency SANA said. SANA said the Syrians met with top intelligence officials including deputy chief of Egypts intelligence agency. It said both sides agreed on ""coordinating political standpoints"" and strengthening the ""cooperation in fighting terrorism."" Egypts pro-government Sada al-Balad and other news websites reported on Sunday that six Syrians arrived on a private jet from Damascus. Earlier this month Egypt voted for rival French and Russian draft resolutions on Syria at the U.N. Security Council arguing that both called for a truce and for aid for besieged Syrians in the rebel-held areas of the northern city of Aleppo. The move angered Egypts major financier Saudi Arabia which supports rebels fighting against Assads Moscow-backed government."

The Syrian opposition has accused government forces of killing well over 1000 civilians with poison gas in Damascus suburbs on Wednesday - an accusation dismissed by the government. World powers have urged Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to allow U.N. chemical weapons inspectors already in Damascus to examine the sites.

Iran is Syrias closest ally and is supporting Assad against opposition forces seeking to overthrow him.

Russian Defense Ministry said that US-led coalition has sharply reduced the intensity of its attacks on ISIS terrorists positions in Iraq following the beginning of military operations of the Syrian Arab Army to liberate Deir Ezzor. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said on Tuesday that The continuing supply of terrorists from Iraq raises serious questions about the objectives of operations against terrorists conducted in the region by aircraft of the United States and the so-called international coalition adding that in the western part of Iraq ISIS-controlled territory continues to increase. Konashenkov affirmed that the actions of the coalition require clarification. Does such a shift in the US and the coalitions priorities mean the desire to complicate the operation conducted by the Syrian army supported by Russias Aerospace Forces to liberate Syrias territory east of the Euphrates? Or is it a possibility to liberate Iraq from ISIS terrorists driving them into Syria under the precise airstrikes of the Russian Aerospace Forces? he questioned. Russias Aerospace Forces carry out up to 150 strikes per day on ISIS terrorists positions near al- Mayadin city in Deir Ezzor supporting the expand military operation of the Syrian army to liberate the city the largest ISIS positions in Deir Ezzor. Konashenkov said that over the past 24 hours Russias aerospace group dealt 182 strikes against the positions of ISIS terrorists who had infiltrated to Deir Ezzor province from Iraq. Two pairs of Sukhoi-34 bombers were commissioned to hit the targets. Fourteen consecutive strikes were made Konashenkov added. Objective monitoring means confirmed the destruction of four tanks three armored personnel carriers and nine off-road vehicles armed with heavy machineguns and two multiple rocket launchers. Fifty terrorists were killed and another 30 sealed off in the underground tunnels Konashenkov said. Forty minutes later a Sukhoi-34 bomber carried out another attack against this stronghold to kill another 20 terrorists who had arrived for evacuating those injured he added. The Russian Aerospace Forces have destroyed the economic infrastructure of ISIS in Syria and foiled any attempts by terrorists to resume the production and illegal sale of hydrocarbons in Syria. ISIS no longer has the sources of financing for purchasing weapons and ammunition and recruiting mercenaries in Syria he said. Konashenkov added a command center of ISIS and three groups of terrorists who had arrived from Iraq had been destroyed near Hatla town. The elimination of 34 terrorists five off-road vehicles carrying large caliber weapons and two trucks full of ammunition has been confirmed he said. Shaza/Mazen

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights based in Britain said 45 opposition fighters and 43 regime forces had been killed in the fighting that began on Thursday. Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP that rebel forces including fighters from Al-Qaedas Syria affiliate Al-Nusra Front had seized the strategic Tal al-Jabiyeh hill on Thursday. Clashes were continuing as the opposition fighters sought to take another hilltop nearby in a bid to connect territory they hold in Daraa and the Quneitra region alongside the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The Observatory said rebel forces had seized weapons and ammunition during the clashes and that regime forces had called in support from heavy artillery and helicopters to try to retake the hill. On Saturday Abdel Rahman said the opposition was focusing its efforts on capturing Tal Jamu some five kilometres (three miles) from Tal al-Jabiyeh in a bid to link areas under its control.

At least four civilians were killed in the city of Arbin and one was killed in each of the cities of Harasta and Douma and the towns of Mesraba Al-Hazza and Jesreen sources from Syrian civil-defense units also known as the ""White Helmets"" told Anadolu Agency anonymously due to security concerns. The airstrikes left dozens of civilians wounded who were transported to hospitals in the area the sources added. Since the beginning of last week eastern Ghouta has been under intensive strikes by regime forces that resulted in the killing of more than 70 people and injuring of many others. The Syrian regime has been stepping up its attacks on Eastern Ghouta even though the district falls within a network of de-escalation zones - endorsed by Turkey Russia and Iran - in which acts of aggression are expressly prohibited. Syria has only just begun to emerge from a devastating civil war that began in early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity. Since then hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the fighting and more than 10 million displaced according to the UN."

Human Rights Watch says in a report issued Wednesday that it collected the names of 69 civilians killed including 19 children by improvised mines in schools homes and on roads in Manbij during a five-day investigation this month. The victims were killed during and after the fighting for control of the town. Ole Solvang deputy emergencies director at the New York-based group says Daesh ""mined virtually everything including quite literally the kitchen sink before they left."" Forces of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) dominated by PKK terrorist organizations Syrian offshoot PYDs armed wing YPG (Peoples Protection Units) took Manbij from Daesh in August after a two-month-long siege over the period of two years after the terrorists moved in. Turkey has voiced reservations in YPG moving into Manbij which has a predominantly Arab population. The country also considers YPG controlling a continuous area south of its border a national security threat and repeatedly asked SDFs main supporter U.S. for YPG to retreat east of the Euphrates River. On Aug. 24 Turkey launched Euphrates Shield operation to clear the towns of Jarablus al Rai and al Bab from Daesh while preventing YPG to extend its control over these towns. Since the operation began Turkish experts and Free Syrian Army (FSA) forces supported by the Turkish military carried out detailed scans after Daesh terrorists were ousted from civilian settlements only to allow civilians return after the towns were fully secured."
